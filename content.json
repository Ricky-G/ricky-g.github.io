{"posts":[{"title":"Ignoring Azurite Files","text":"🎯 TL;DR: Managing Azurite Storage Emulation Files in VS Code Local development with Azure Functions often requires Azurite (Azure Storage Emulator replacement) which generates storage files that clutter VS Code workspace. Problem: __azurite__, __blobstorage__, and __queuestorage__ directories appear in project explorer making navigation difficult. Solution: Configure VS Code files.exclude settings to hide these emulation artifacts while preserving their functionality for local development and testing. In the old days, developers relied on the Azure Storage Emulator to emulate Azure Storage services locally. However, Azure Storage Emulator has been deprecated and replaced with Azurite, which is now the recommended way to emulate Azure Blob, Queue, and Table storage locally. In this post, let’s see how to set up exclusions in Visual Studio Code to prevent unwanted Azurite files from cluttering your workspace while working with Function Apps. Starting Azurite ServicesIn Visual Studio Code, you can start Azurite services Visual Studio Code: Setting Up File ExclusionsAzurite’s local emulation files, while essential, can quickly overpopulate your project. To keep them hidden, Visual Studio Code’s files.exclude feature allows you to filter them out. Here’s how to add the necessary configuration to hide these files. Open the settings.json file in your project. Add the following block to exclude Azurite files: 12345&quot;files.exclude&quot;: { &quot;__azurite__&quot;: true, &quot;__blobstorage__&quot;: true, &quot;__queuestorage__&quot;: true} This will automatically hide Azurite-related files from the VS Code explorer. ConclusionBy setting up file exclusions in Visual Studio Code and .gitignore, you can prevent clutter from unnecessary Azurite files. This streamlines your development process and keeps your project cleaner.

The solution configures GPT-4o Realtime for text-only output (ContentModalities.Text) and routes responses through Azure Speech Services, enabling access to 400+ neural voices, custom neural voices (CNV), and SSML control. The implementation includes intelligent barge-in functionality using real-time audio amplitude monitoring, allowing users to interrupt the assistant naturally mid-response. Technical implementation: C# application using Azure.AI.OpenAI and Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech SDKs, NAudio for audio I/O, streaming text collection from GPT-4o responses, RMS-based speech detection with configurable thresholds, and concurrent audio management for seamless interruption handling. Complete C# source code with audio helpers available here Building realtime voice-enabled applications with Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4o Realtime model is incredibly powerful, but there’s one significant limitation that can be a deal-breaker for many use cases: you’re stuck with OpenAI’s predefined voices like “sage”, “alloy”, “echo”, “fable”, “onyx”, and “nova”. What if you’re building a branded customer service bot that needs to match your company’s voice identity? Or developing a therapeutic application for children with autism where the voice quality and tone are crucial for engagement? What if your users need to interrupt the assistant naturally, just like in real human conversations? In this comprehensive guide, I’ll show you exactly how I solved these challenges by building a hybrid solution that combines the conversational intelligence of GPT-4o Realtime with the voice flexibility of Azure Speech Services. We’ll dive deep into the implementation, covering everything from the initial problem to the complete working solution. flowchart TD A[👤 User speaks] --> B[🎤 Microphone Input] B --> C{Barge-in DetectionAudio Level > Threshold?} C -->|Yes| D[🛑 Stop Azure Speech] C -->|No| E[📡 Stream to GPT-4o Realtime] E --> F[🧠 GPT-4o Processing] F --> G[📝 Text ResponseContentModalities.Text] G --> H[🗣️ Azure Speech ServicesCustom/Neural Voice] H --> I[🔊 Audio Output] D --> E I --> J[👂 User hears response] J --> A style A fill:#e1f5fe style D fill:#ffebee style G fill:#f3e5f5 style H fill:#e8f5e8 style I fill:#fff3e0 The real problem: Why GPT-4o Realtime’s voice limitations matterWhen you’re working with Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4o Realtime API, the standard approach involves configuring a RealtimeConversationSession with one of the predefined voices. While these voices are high-quality, they create several significant limitations: 1. Limited voice selectionYou’re restricted to just six built-in voices. There’s no access to Azure Speech Services’ extensive catalog of 400+ neural voices across 140+ languages and locales. You can’t use premium voices like Jenny Neural (en-US) or specialized voices optimized for different use cases. 2. No custom neural voicesPerhaps most importantly, you can’t integrate custom neural voices (CNV) that you’ve trained in Azure Speech Studio. This is crucial for: Brand consistency: Companies that have invested in custom voice branding Specialized applications: Healthcare, education, or accessibility apps requiring specific voice characteristics Multilingual scenarios: Custom voices trained on specific accents or dialects 3. No natural interruption (barge-in)The built-in system doesn’t provide a way for users to naturally interrupt the assistant mid-response. In real conversations, we constantly interrupt each other—it’s natural and expected. Without this capability, your bot feels robotic and frustrating to use. 4. Limited voice controlYou can’t dynamically adjust speech rate, pitch, or emphasis using SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) that Azure Speech Services supports. The solution: Hybrid architecture with Azure Speech ServicesThe solution I’ve developed bypasses GPT-4o’s built-in text-to-speech entirely and routes the conversation text through Azure Speech Services. Here’s the high-level architecture: Configure GPT-4o for text-only output: Disable built-in audio synthesis Stream and capture text responses: Collect the assistant’s text as it streams Route text to Azure Speech Services: Use any voice from Azure’s catalog or your custom neural voices Implement intelligent barge-in: Monitor microphone input and stop speech when user starts talking Seamless audio management: Handle audio playback and interruption smoothly This approach gives you the best of both worlds: GPT-4o’s intelligent conversation handling with Azure Speech Services’ superior voice options and control. Deep dive: Implementation walkthroughLet me walk you through the complete implementation, explaining each component and how they work together. Project structure and dependenciesFirst, let’s look at the project structure. The solution consists of several key components: 12345678RealtimeChat/├── Program.cs # Main application logic├── AppSettings.cs # Configuration classes├── Constants.cs # Application constants└── Helpers/ ├── AudioInputHelper.cs # Microphone input and barge-in detection ├── AudioOutputHelper.cs # Audio playback management └── ConsoleHelper.cs # Console UI utilities The key NuGet packages you’ll need: Azure.AI.OpenAI - For GPT-4o Realtime API Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech - For Azure Speech Services NAudio - For audio input/output handling Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json - For configuration management Configuration setupThe configuration is designed to be flexible and environment-specific. Here’s the complete AppSettings.cs structure: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829public class AppSettings{ public AzureOpenAISettings AzureOpenAI { get; set; } = new(); public AzureSpeechSettings AzureSpeech { get; set; } = new(); public ConversationSettings Conversation { get; set; } = new(); public double BargeInThreshold { get; set; }}public class AzureOpenAISettings{ public string Endpoint { get; set; } = &quot;&quot;; public string ApiKey { get; set; } = &quot;&quot;; public string ChatModelName { get; set; } = &quot;&quot;; public string RealtimeModelName { get; set; } = &quot;&quot;;}public class AzureSpeechSettings{ public string SubscriptionKey { get; set; } = &quot;&quot;; public string Region { get; set; } = &quot;&quot;; public string VoiceName { get; set; } = &quot;&quot;;}public class ConversationSettings{ public string OpenAIBuiltInVoice { get; set; } = &quot;sage&quot;; public float ServerDetectionThreshold { get; set; } = 0.1f; public int ServerSilenceMs { get; set; } = 150;} And your appsettings.json: 12345678910111213141516171819{ &quot;AzureOpenAI&quot;: { &quot;Endpoint&quot;: &quot;https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/&quot;, &quot;ApiKey&quot;: &quot;your-openai-api-key&quot;, &quot;ChatModelName&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;, &quot;RealtimeModelName&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o-realtime-preview&quot; }, &quot;AzureSpeech&quot;: { &quot;SubscriptionKey&quot;: &quot;your-speech-service-key&quot;, &quot;Region&quot;: &quot;australiaeast&quot;, &quot;VoiceName&quot;: &quot;en-US-AnaNeural&quot; }, &quot;Conversation&quot;: { &quot;OpenAIBuiltInVoice&quot;: &quot;sage&quot;, &quot;ServerDetectionThreshold&quot;: 0.1, &quot;ServerSilenceMs&quot;: 150 }, &quot;BargeInThreshold&quot;: 0.02} The heart of the solution: Program.csThe main program orchestrates all the components. Let’s break down the key sections: Service initialization1234567891011121314151617static (SpeechConfig, AzureOpenAIClient) InitializeServices(AppSettings appSettings){ // Configure Azure Speech Services SpeechConfig speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription( appSettings.AzureSpeech.SubscriptionKey, appSettings.AzureSpeech.Region ); speechConfig.SpeechSynthesisVoiceName = appSettings.AzureSpeech.VoiceName; // Configure Azure OpenAI client var aoaiClient = new AzureOpenAIClient( new Uri(appSettings.AzureOpenAI.Endpoint), new ApiKeyCredential(appSettings.AzureOpenAI.ApiKey) ); return (speechConfig, aoaiClient);} Critical: Text-only configurationThis is the key breakthrough—configuring GPT-4o Realtime to output only text, not audio: 123456789101112await session.ConfigureSessionAsync(new ConversationSessionOptions(){ Voice = new ConversationVoice(appSettings.Conversation.OpenAIBuiltInVoice), ContentModalities = ConversationContentModalities.Text, // 🔥 This is crucial! Instructions = Constants.MainPrompt, InputTranscriptionOptions = new() { Model = &quot;whisper-1&quot; }, TurnDetectionOptions = ConversationTurnDetectionOptions .CreateServerVoiceActivityTurnDetectionOptions( detectionThreshold: appSettings.Conversation.ServerDetectionThreshold, silenceDuration: TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(appSettings.Conversation.ServerSilenceMs) ),}); By setting ContentModalities = ConversationContentModalities.Text, we tell GPT-4o to only send us text responses, not audio bytes. This is what allows us to route the text through Azure Speech Services instead. Advanced barge-in implementationThe barge-in feature is implemented in AudioInputHelper.cs and is one of the most sophisticated parts of the solution. Here’s how it works: Real-time amplitude monitoring1234567891011121314151617181920private bool IsSpeechAboveThreshold(byte[] buffer, int length, double threshold){ double sum = 0.0; int sampleCount = length / 2; // 16-bit samples for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i += 2) { short sample = BitConverter.ToInt16(buffer, i); sum += sample * (double)sample; } // Calculate RMS (Root Mean Square) of the audio double rms = Math.Sqrt(sum / sampleCount); // Normalize to [0..1] range double normalized = rms / 32768.0; // Compare to threshold return normalized &gt; threshold;} Smart barge-in event handling1234567891011121314151617181920_waveInEvent.DataAvailable += (_, e) =&gt;{ // 1. Always copy to ring buffer for GPT-4o input lock (_bufferLock) { // ... buffer management code ... } // 2. Check for user speech (barge-in detection) if (IsSpeechAboveThreshold(e.Buffer, e.BytesRecorded, _bargeInThreshold)) { var now = DateTime.UtcNow; // Prevent event spam with cooldown period if ((now - _lastSpeechDetected).TotalMilliseconds &gt; 500) { _lastSpeechDetected = now; UserSpeechDetected?.Invoke(); // Trigger barge-in! } }}; Barge-in event wiringIn the main session handler, we wire up the barge-in detection: 12345678910111213141516171819static void HandleSessionStartedUpdate(RealtimeConversationSession session, AppSettings appSettings, SpeechSynthesizer? currentSynthesizer){ _ = Task.Run(async () =&gt; { using AudioInputHelper audioInputHelper = AudioInputHelper.Start(appSettings.BargeInThreshold); audioInputHelper.UserSpeechDetected += () =&gt; { ConsoleHelper.DisplayMessage(&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt; USER INTERRUPTION DETECTED! Stopping speech...&quot;, true); if (currentSynthesizer != null) { currentSynthesizer.StopSpeakingAsync().Wait(); // Stop immediately! } }; await session.SendInputAudioAsync(audioInputHelper); });} Streaming text processing and Azure Speech integrationThe magic happens in how we handle the streaming response from GPT-4o and route it to Azure Speech Services: Collecting streaming text1234567891011121314151617181920static void HandleStreamingPartDeltaUpdate( ConversationItemStreamingPartDeltaUpdate deltaUpdate, Dictionary&lt;string, StringBuilder&gt; partialTextByItemId, AudioOutputHelper audioOutputHelper){ string chunk = deltaUpdate.Text ?? deltaUpdate.AudioTranscript; if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(chunk)) { if (!partialTextByItemId.ContainsKey(deltaUpdate.ItemId)) { partialTextByItemId[deltaUpdate.ItemId] = new StringBuilder(); } partialTextByItemId[deltaUpdate.ItemId].Append(chunk); } // NOTE: We completely ignore deltaUpdate.AudioBytes since we're using Azure Speech // Uncomment the next line if you want to fall back to built-in voice: // audioOutputHelper.EnqueueForPlayback(deltaUpdate.AudioBytes);} Converting text to speech with Azure Speech Services12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546static async Task HandleStreamingFinishedUpdate( ConversationItemStreamingFinishedUpdate itemFinishedUpdate, Dictionary&lt;string, StringBuilder&gt; partialTextByItemId, SpeechConfig speechConfig, SpeechSynthesizer? currentSynthesizer){ if (partialTextByItemId.TryGetValue(itemFinishedUpdate.ItemId, out var sb)) { string finalAssistantText = sb.ToString(); ConsoleHelper.DisplayMessage($&quot;Assistant: {finalAssistantText}&quot;, true); // Route to Azure Speech Services await SpeakWithAzureSpeechAsync(finalAssistantText, speechConfig, currentSynthesizer); partialTextByItemId.Remove(itemFinishedUpdate.ItemId); }}static async Task&lt;SpeechSynthesizer?&gt; SpeakWithAzureSpeechAsync( string text, SpeechConfig speechConfig, SpeechSynthesizer? synthesizer){ if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(text)) return synthesizer; // Stop any current speech before starting new if (synthesizer != null) { await synthesizer.StopSpeakingAsync(); } // Synthesize with Azure Speech Services var result = await synthesizer.SpeakTextAsync(text); if (result.Reason == ResultReason.SynthesizingAudioCompleted) { Console.WriteLine(&quot;✅ Speech synthesis completed successfully&quot;); } else if (result.Reason == ResultReason.Canceled) { var cancellation = SpeechSynthesisCancellationDetails.FromResult(result); Console.WriteLine($&quot;❌ Speech canceled: {cancellation.Reason}, {cancellation.ErrorDetails}&quot;); } return synthesizer;} Advanced scenarios and customizationUsing custom neural voicesTo use a custom neural voice you’ve trained in Azure Speech Studio, simply update your configuration: 1234567{ &quot;AzureSpeech&quot;: { &quot;VoiceName&quot;: &quot;YourCustomVoiceName&quot;, // Your CNV endpoint name &quot;Region&quot;: &quot;eastus&quot;, // Region where your CNV is deployed &quot;SubscriptionKey&quot;: &quot;your-key&quot; }} SSML support for advanced voice controlYou can enhance the speech synthesis with SSML for better control: 12345678910111213static async Task SpeakWithSSMLAsync(string text, SpeechConfig speechConfig, SpeechSynthesizer synthesizer){ string ssml = $@&quot; &lt;speak version='1.0' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis' xml:lang='en-US'&gt; &lt;voice name='{speechConfig.SpeechSynthesisVoiceName}'&gt; &lt;prosody rate='medium' pitch='medium'&gt; {System.Security.SecurityElement.Escape(text)} &lt;/prosody&gt; &lt;/voice&gt; &lt;/speak&gt;&quot;; await synthesizer.SpeakSsmlAsync(ssml);} Fine-tuning barge-in sensitivityThe barge-in threshold is crucial for a good user experience. Too sensitive, and background noise triggers interruptions. Too high, and users can’t interrupt naturally: 123{ &quot;BargeInThreshold&quot;: 0.02 // Start here and adjust based on your environment} Values to try: 0.01: Very sensitive (good for quiet environments) 0.02: Balanced (recommended starting point) 0.05: Less sensitive (noisy environments) Error handling and resilienceThe solution includes comprehensive error handling: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829static void HandleErrorUpdate(ConversationErrorUpdate errorUpdate){ ConsoleHelper.DisplayError($&quot;❌ GPT-4o Error: {errorUpdate.Message}&quot;, true); // Log full error details for debugging ConsoleHelper.DisplayError($&quot;Full error details: {errorUpdate.GetRawContent()}&quot;, false); // Could implement retry logic here}static async Task HandleSpeechStartedUpdate( ConversationInputSpeechStartedUpdate speechStartedUpdate, SpeechSynthesizer? currentSynthesizer){ ConsoleHelper.DisplayMessage($&quot;🎤 Speech detected @ {speechStartedUpdate.AudioStartTime}&quot;, true); // Always stop current speech when user starts talking if (currentSynthesizer != null) { try { await currentSynthesizer.StopSpeakingAsync(); } catch (Exception ex) { ConsoleHelper.DisplayError($&quot;Error stopping speech: {ex.Message}&quot;, false); } }} Performance considerations and optimizationLatency optimizationThe hybrid approach adds minimal latency: GPT-4o streaming: Near real-time text streaming Azure Speech synthesis: 100-300ms for typical responses Barge-in detection: &lt;50ms response time Memory managementThe ring buffer implementation efficiently manages audio data: 12// ~10 seconds buffer to handle network variationsprivate readonly byte[] _buffer = new byte[BYTES_PER_SAMPLE * SAMPLES_PER_SECOND * CHANNELS * 10]; Concurrent operationsThe solution handles multiple concurrent operations smoothly: Microphone input streaming to GPT-4o Real-time text streaming from GPT-4o Audio synthesis and playback via Azure Speech Barge-in detection and response Deployment and production considerationsSecurity best practices API key management: Use Azure Key Vault for production Network security: Implement proper firewall rules Authentication: Add user authentication for production apps Scaling considerations Connection limits: Both services have concurrent connection limits Regional deployment: Deploy Speech Services in the same region as OpenAI Cost optimization: Monitor token usage and synthesis characters Monitoring and loggingImplement comprehensive logging for production: 123456// Add structured loggingservices.AddLogging(builder =&gt;{ builder.AddConsole(); builder.AddApplicationInsights(); // For production monitoring}); Conclusion and next stepsThis hybrid approach solves the key limitations of GPT-4o Realtime’s built-in voices by providing: ✅ Unlimited voice selection: Access to 400+ Azure Speech neural voices✅ Custom neural voice support: Use your own trained voices✅ Natural barge-in capability: Users can interrupt naturally✅ SSML support: Advanced voice control and customization✅ Production-ready architecture: Robust error handling and performance The complete sample code is available in my custom-voice-sample-code folder, which you can use as a starting point for your own applications. What’s next?Consider these enhancements for your implementation: Multiple voice support: Let users choose their preferred voice Emotion detection: Adjust voice characteristics based on conversation sentiment Multi-language support: Dynamically switch languages and voices Integration with Teams/Bot Framework: Extend to enterprise chat platforms The combination of GPT-4o’s conversational intelligence with Azure Speech Services’ voice flexibility opens up entirely new possibilities for voice-enabled applications. Whether you’re building customer service bots, educational tools, or therapeutic applications, this approach gives you the control and quality you need for professional deployments.

There were so many times I was asked some very good questions which I am sure not just the person asking me but a lot more would have been interested in knowing the answer/solution/thoughts around the matter. This is a way to write about that and help the wider community who are searching for similar solutions. I regularly answer in Stack Overflow and in some cases I wrote a question and answered it myself just incase some one was looking for something similar, that wasn’t really the ideal platform to do that. There have been so many times that going through and reading other people’s blogs have helped me and unlocked me in problems that I was stuck with; this is a in a way trying to give back to the community and helping people that are on the look out for a solution for a similar problem. How to power the blogThere were so many choices out there when it came to what frameworks and libraries to use to build the blog and what to use to host the blog. My requirements when it came to building were simple Easy to author posts Easy to build Easy to maintain Most customizations (eg: search, ads, tags, categories etc) should come out of the box My requirements when it came to hosting were even simpler Has to be free Has to be able to handle ‘some’ level of load Easy to CI/CD Main choices here boiled down to: Orchard CMS Hugo Ghost Jekyll With Github Pages Hexo All the options were good, I really liked Hugo, it was so easy to create a site. But all of them were geared towards creating a CMS / generic site. I was looking for something that had all the things needed for a blog out of the box with out having to grab lots of plugins or write something custom. Jekyll and GitHub pages were really good, it nailed most of the things, but I didn’t really want to go down the road of learning Jekyll just to host a blog. This left one and Hexo fit my requirements beautifully. It was a dedicated Javascript framework that has all the things I was looking for out of the box and it had 360+ themes available all community built and free. One thing I loved about Hexo is the fact its builds the source to a static site and you can use GitHub to host the static site and use GitHub Actions to build the static site from source. This is what I went with in the end, Hexo to build the blog. I write everything in markdown files and Hexo builds it out into a nice static site and I host it using GitHub pages as a public repo There are some limits of hosting with GitHub Pages, the main one is the 100GB of bandwidth as a soft limit. Since this is just a static site 100GB should be plenty but if and when it comes to that I will look at putting a CDN in front. Final Result Hexo to build the blog into a static site Icarus theme GitHub Pages to host the site Bulma to help enrich the markdown files with styling ReferencesAs always a big thank you to Unsplash for providing a huge range of images for free Cover image has been taken from https://unsplash.com/photos/3SIXZisims4","link":"/Blog/hello-world-%F0%9F%91%8B/"},{"title":"Getting TFVC Repository Structure via Azure DevOps Server API","text":"🎯 TL;DR: Retrieving TFVC Repository Structure via REST API This post demonstrates how to programmatically enumerate TFVC repository folders using Azure DevOps Server REST APIs. Unlike Git repositories, TFVC follows a one-repository-per-project model with hierarchical folder structures starting at $/ProjectName. The solution uses the TFVC Items API with specific parameters: scopePath=$/ProjectName to target the project root, and recursionLevel=OneLevel to retrieve immediate children. The implementation handles authentication via Personal Access Tokens, filters results to show only folders (excluding the root), and includes error handling for projects without TFVC repositories or insufficient permissions. Key technical details: PowerShell script implementation, proper API parameter usage, authentication setup, and handling edge cases like empty repositories and access permissions. Complete PowerShell script and utilities available here Recently, I was asked an interesting question by a developer who was struggling with Azure DevOps Server APIs around fetching repository metadata for legacy TFVC structures as part of a GitHub migration from ADO Server. This was a nice little problem to solve because, let’s be honest, we don’t really deal with these legacy TFVC repositories much anymore. Most teams have migrated to Git, and the documentation around TFVC API interactions has become somewhat sparse over the years. The challenge was straightforward but frustrating: they could retrieve project information just fine, but getting the actual TFVC folder structure within each project? That’s where things got tricky. After doing a bit of digging through the API documentation and testing different approaches, I’m happy to say that yes, it is absolutely possible to enumerate all TFVC repositories and their folder structures programmatically. This blog post shares the solution I put together - a practical approach to retrieve TFVC repository structure using the Azure DevOps Server REST APIs. If you’re working with legacy TFVC repositories and need to interact with them programmatically, this one’s for you. The Challenge: Understanding TFVC API LimitationsUnlike Git repositories where each project can contain multiple repos, TFVC follows a different model where each project contains exactly one TFVC repository. This fundamental difference affects how you interact with the API and retrieve repository information. The main challenge developers face is distinguishing between project metadata and actual TFVC repository structure. When calling the standard Projects API, you receive project information but not the folder structure within the TFVC repository itself. Common Misconceptions About TFVC APIsMany developers make the mistake of thinking that the Projects API or the Items API with default parameters will return the TFVC folder structure. Here’s what typically happens: What doesn’t work: Using only the Projects API - returns project metadata, not TFVC structure Calling Items API without proper scopePath parameter - returns all items across the organization Using the Branches API - doesn’t apply to TFVC repositories the same way as Git The root cause: The API requires specific parameters to traverse the TFVC hierarchy correctly. Understanding TFVC Repository StructureIn TFVC, the repository structure follows this pattern: Each project has one TFVC repository The repository root is always $/ProjectName Folders are organized hierarchically under this root You need to specify recursion levels to control how deep the API traverses The Solution: Targeted API Calls with Proper ParametersThe key to retrieving TFVC folder structure lies in using the correct combination of API endpoints and parameters. Here’s the step-by-step approach: Step 1: Get All ProjectsFirst, retrieve all projects in your Azure DevOps Server instance using the Projects API. Step 2: Query TFVC Items for Each ProjectFor each project, call the TFVC Items API with these specific parameters: scopePath=$/ProjectName - Sets the starting point to the project’s TFVC root recursionLevel=OneLevel - Returns immediate children only (not recursive) Filter results to show only folders, excluding the root itself PowerShell Script ImplementationHere’s a complete PowerShell script that implements this solution. You can find the full script and additional TFVC utilities in my TFS/TFVC Scripts collection: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041# Azure DevOps Server configuration$tfsUrl = &quot;https://mytfs.com&quot;$PAT = &quot;your-personal-access-token&quot;# Create authentication headers$headers = @{ Authorization = &quot;Basic &quot; + [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(&quot;:$PAT&quot;))}# Get all projects$projects = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri &quot;$tfsUrl/DefaultCollection/_apis/projects?api-version=5.0&quot; -Headers $headersforeach ($project in $projects.value) { Write-Host &quot;Project: $($project.name)&quot; # Construct TFVC path for this project $tfvcPath = &quot;`$/$($project.name)&quot; $itemsUrl = &quot;$tfsUrl/DefaultCollection/$($project.id)/_apis/tfvc/items?scopePath=$tfvcPath&amp;recursionLevel=OneLevel&amp;api-version=5.0&quot; try { # Get TFVC items for this project $items = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $itemsUrl -Headers $headers # Filter to get only folders (excluding the root itself) $folders = $items.value | Where-Object { $_.isFolder -eq $true -and $_.path -ne $tfvcPath } foreach ($folder in $folders) { Write-Host &quot; - $($folder.path)&quot; } if ($folders.Count -eq 0) { Write-Host &quot; No top-level folders found&quot; } } catch { Write-Host &quot; No TFVC content or access denied&quot; }} Script Configuration and SecurityPersonal Access Token SetupTo use this script, you’ll need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions: Navigate to your Azure DevOps Server user settings Create a new Personal Access Token Grant Code (read) permissions at minimum Copy the token and replace your-personal-access-token in the script URL ConfigurationReplace https://mytfs.com with your actual Azure DevOps Server URL. The format should be: On-premises TFS: https://your-tfs-server Azure DevOps Server: https://your-server-name Understanding the API ResponseThe TFVC Items API returns objects with these key properties: 123456{ &quot;path&quot;: &quot;$/ProjectName/FolderName&quot;, &quot;isFolder&quot;: true, &quot;version&quot;: 12345, &quot;size&quot;: 0} Important properties: path: The full TFVC path to the item isFolder: Boolean indicating if the item is a folder version: The changeset number when this item was last modified Error Handling and Edge CasesThe script includes error handling for common scenarios: No TFVC Repository: Some projects might not have TFVC repositories initialized. The script catches these cases and displays an appropriate message. Access Permissions: If your PAT doesn’t have sufficient permissions for a project, the API call will fail gracefully. Empty Repositories: Projects with TFVC repositories but no folders will display “No top-level folders found.” Advanced CustomizationsFiltering Specific ProjectsTo target specific projects, you can filter the projects array: 1$projects = $projects.value | Where-Object { $_.name -like &quot;*YourFilter*&quot; } Deeper RecursionTo get more than just top-level folders, change the recursionLevel parameter: OneLevel: Immediate children only Full: Complete hierarchy (use with caution on large repositories) Output FormattingYou can modify the output format to suit your needs: 12345678910# Export to CSV$results = @()foreach ($folder in $folders) { $results += [PSCustomObject]@{ Project = $project.name FolderPath = $folder.path LastModified = $folder.version }}$results | Export-Csv -Path &quot;tfvc-folders.csv&quot; -NoTypeInformation Performance ConsiderationsFor organizations with many projects, consider implementing: Parallel Processing: Use PowerShell jobs or runspaces to query multiple projects simultaneously. Pagination: For large result sets, implement pagination using the $skip and $top parameters. Caching: Store results locally if you need to run the script frequently. Troubleshooting Common IssuesAuthentication Failures Verify your PAT is not expired Ensure the PAT has sufficient permissions Check that your TFS URL is correct and accessible Empty Results Confirm the project actually uses TFVC (not Git) Verify you have read permissions on the project Check if the TFVC repository has been initialized API Version CompatibilityThe script uses API version 5.0, which is compatible with: Team Foundation Server 2019 and later Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later For older TFS versions, you might need to use API version 1.0 or 2.0. Best Practices for TFVC API IntegrationUse Specific API Versions: Always specify the API version to ensure consistent behavior across different server versions. Implement Proper Error Handling: TFVC repositories can have various states, and not all projects may have TFVC initialized. Respect Rate Limits: While on-premises servers typically don’t have strict rate limits, implement appropriate delays if querying large numbers of projects. Secure Credential Management: Store PATs securely and rotate them regularly according to your organization’s security policies. Integration with CI/CD PipelinesThis script can be integrated into DevOps workflows for: Repository Auditing: Generate reports of TFVC repository structures across your organization. Migration Planning: Identify repository structures before migrating from TFVC to Git. Compliance Reporting: Document your source control structure for regulatory requirements. Key TakeawaysWorking with TFVC repositories via REST API requires understanding the fundamental differences between TFVC and Git repository models.

The system intercepts incoming calls via Azure Communication Services, streams audio in real-time to the Voice Live API, and processes conversations through pre-configured AI agents in Azure AI Studio. The implementation uses FastAPI for webhook handling, WebSocket connections for bidirectional audio streaming, and Azure Managed Identity for authentication (no API keys to manage). The architecture handles multiple concurrent calls on a single Python thread using asyncio. Implementation details: Audio resampling between 16kHz (ACS requirement) and 24kHz (Voice Live requirement), connection resilience for preview services, and production deployment considerations. Full source code and documentation available here Recently, I found myself co-leading an innovation project that pushed me into uncharted territory. The challenge? Developing a voice-based agentic solution with an ambitious goal - routing at least 25% of current contact center calls to AI voice agents. This was bleeding-edge stuff, with both the Azure Voice Live API and Azure AI Agent Service voice agents still in preview at the time of writing. When you’re working with preview services, documentation is often sparse, and you quickly learn that reverse engineering network calls and maintaining close relationships with product teams becomes part of your daily routine. This blog post shares the practical lessons learned and the working solution we built to integrate these cutting-edge services. The Innovation ChallengeBuilding a voice agent system that could handle real customer interactions meant tackling several complex requirements: Real-time voice processing with minimal latency Natural conversation flow without awkward pauses Integration with existing contact center infrastructure Scalability to handle multiple concurrent calls Reliability for production use cases With both Azure Voice Live API and Azure AI Voice Agent Service in preview, we were essentially building on shifting sands. But that’s what innovation is about - pushing boundaries and finding solutions where documentation doesn’t yet exist. Understanding the ArchitectureOur solution bridges Azure Communication Services (ACS) with Azure AI services to create an intelligent voice agent.

You can find the complete code in my GitHub repository. PrerequisitesFirst, you’ll need to set up several Azure services. Here’s what we discovered through trial and error: 12345# Required Azure services- Azure Communication Services (with phone number provisioning)- Azure AI Services (Speech Service enabled)- Azure AI Agent Service (with voice capabilities)- Azure App Service or Container Instance (for hosting) Environment ConfigurationOne of the first challenges was figuring out all the required configuration parameters. Here’s what you’ll need: 123456# Essential environment variables (Using Azure Managed Identity - No API Keys!)ACS_CONNECTION_STRING = &quot;endpoint=https://your-acs.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=your-key&quot;AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_ENDPOINT = &quot;https://your-aoai.cognitiveservices.azure.com/&quot;AGENT_ID = &quot;your_agent_id_from_azure_ai_studio&quot;AGENT_PROJECT_NAME = &quot;your_project_name&quot;BASE_URL = &quot;https://your-tunnel-url.asse.devtunnels.ms&quot; # Dev Tunnel URL Building the WebSocket BridgeThe heart of our solution is a Python application that acts as a bridge between ACS and the Voice Live API. This wasn’t documented anywhere - we had to figure it out by analyzing network traffic and experimenting.

The Voice Live API uses WebRTC for real-time audio streaming, but the documentation was minimal. Here’s what we discovered: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233async def establish_voice_connection(call_connection_id): &quot;&quot;&quot;Establish WebSocket connection to Voice Live API using Azure Managed Identity&quot;&quot;&quot; # Get access token using managed identity from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential credential = DefaultAzureCredential() token = credential.get_token(&quot;https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default&quot;) # Construct the WebSocket URL for Voice Live API ws_url = f&quot;wss://your-region.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/realtime?api-version=2024-10-01-preview&quot; headers = { &quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;Bearer {token.token}&quot;, &quot;OpenAI-Beta&quot;: &quot;realtime=v1&quot; } async with websockets.connect(ws_url, extra_headers=headers) as websocket: # Initialize session with Agent ID await websocket.send(json.dumps({ &quot;type&quot;: &quot;session.update&quot;, &quot;session&quot;: { &quot;agent&quot;: { &quot;agent_id&quot;: AGENT_ID, &quot;project_name&quot;: AGENT_PROJECT_NAME } } })) # Handle bidirectional audio streaming await asyncio.gather( receive_audio_from_caller(websocket, call_connection_id), send_audio_to_caller(websocket, call_connection_id) ) Integrating with Azure AI Agent ServiceThe AI Agent Service provides the intelligence for our voice agent.

Here are some key challenges we solved: 1. Audio Format CompatibilityThe Voice Live API expects specific audio formats. We discovered through trial and error: 12345678910111213# Audio configuration that actually works (Voice Live API format)AUDIO_CONFIG = { &quot;format&quot;: &quot;pcm16&quot;, # 16-bit PCM for Voice Live API &quot;sample_rate&quot;: 24000, # 24kHz required by Voice Live &quot;channels&quot;: 1 # Mono}# ACS requires 16kHz, so we need resamplingACS_AUDIO_CONFIG = { &quot;format&quot;: &quot;pcm16&quot;, &quot;sample_rate&quot;: 16000, # ACS requirement &quot;channels&quot;: 1} 2. Latency OptimizationTo achieve natural conversation flow, we implemented several optimizations: 123456789101112# Start voice synthesis before full response is readyasync def stream_synthesize_speech(text_stream): &quot;&quot;&quot;Synthesize speech in chunks for lower latency&quot;&quot;&quot; buffer = &quot;&quot; async for chunk in text_stream: buffer += chunk # Send to synthesis when we have a complete sentence if any(punct in buffer for punct in ['.', '!', '?']): await synthesize_and_send(buffer) buffer = &quot;&quot; 3. Connection ResiliencePreview services can be unstable. We added robust error handling: 123456789101112131415161718async def maintain_connection(websocket, call_id): &quot;&quot;&quot;Maintain WebSocket connection with automatic reconnection&quot;&quot;&quot; retry_count = 0 max_retries = 3 while retry_count &lt; max_retries: try: await websocket.ping() await asyncio.sleep(30) # Ping every 30 seconds except websockets.ConnectionClosed: logger.warning(f&quot;Connection lost for call {call_id}&quot;) retry_count += 1 await asyncio.sleep(2 ** retry_count) # Exponential backoff # Attempt reconnection websocket = await reconnect_websocket(call_id) Deployment ConsiderationsWhen deploying this solution, we learned several important lessons: Container DeploymentWe packaged our Python application as a container for easier deployment: 12345678910111213141516FROM python:3.11-slimWORKDIR /app# Install system dependencies for audio processingRUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \\ libopus0 \\ libopus-dev \\ &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*COPY requirements.txt .RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txtCOPY . .CMD [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;start.py&quot;] Scaling ConsiderationsFor handling multiple concurrent calls: Use Azure Container Instances or App Service with autoscaling Implement connection pooling for WebSocket connections Monitor memory usage - audio processing can be memory-intensive Monitoring and DebuggingWorking with preview services means extensive logging is crucial: 12345678910import loggingfrom azure.monitor.opentelemetry import configure_azure_monitor# Configure Azure Monitor for production debuggingconfigure_azure_monitor( connection_string=APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING)# Log all WebSocket eventslogging.getLogger('websockets').setLevel(logging.DEBUG) Lessons LearnedAfter weeks of development and close collaboration with Azure product teams, here are our key takeaways: Preview Services Require Patience: Be prepared for undocumented features and changing APIs Network Analysis is Your Friend: Tools like Wireshark helped us understand the protocol Build in Resilience: Assume connections will drop and services will be intermittently unavailable Start Simple: Get basic voice working before adding complex AI interactions Monitor Everything: You’ll need extensive logging to debug issues in production Get StartedReady to build your own voice agent?

The solution uses a shared Azure VM (Standard D8s v3) with individual user accounts, certificate-based SSH authentication, and VS Code Remote Development connected to a shared Dev Container environment. The architecture eliminates “works on my machine” issues by providing consistent development environments, shared resources (datasets, models, configs), and enables real-time collaboration. Implementation highlights: Automated user provisioning scripts, VS Code Remote-SSH configuration, comprehensive devcontainer.json with pre-installed Python 3.12/AutoGen/Azure CLI, shared directory structures, and security hardening with fail2ban and UFW. Development environment setup scripts and configurations documented here Introduction: When Traditional Solutions Hit a WallLast month, I found myself facing a challenge that I’m sure many of you have encountered: How do you enable seamless collaboration for a development team when half of them work in a locked-down environment where they can’t install any development tools, and the other half can’t access the client’s systems? Our team of eight developers was tasked with building a proof-of-concept (PoC) for an AI-powered agentic system using Microsoft’s AutoGen framework. Here’s the kicker: this was a 3-week PoC sprint bringing together two teams from different organizations who had never worked together before. We needed a collaborative environment that could be spun up quickly, require minimal setup effort, and allow everyone to hit the ground running from day one. The project requirements were complex enough, but the real challenge? Four developers worked from a highly restricted corporate environment where installing Python, VS Code, or any development tools was strictly prohibited. The remaining four worked from our offices but couldn’t access the client’s internal systems directly. We tried the usual approaches: RDP connections: Blocked by security policies VPN access: Denied due to compliance requirements Local development with file sharing: Immediate sync issues and “works on my machine” problems Cloud IDEs: Didn’t meet the client’s security requirements Just when we thought we’d have to resort to the dreaded “develop locally and pray it works in production” approach, we discovered a solution that not only solved our immediate problem but revolutionized how we approach distributed development. The Architecture That Worked For UsHere’s a visual representation of what we built, everyone had to work on their personal (non-corporate) laptops for this to work. flowchart TD A[\"� 8 Developers on Personal Laptops4 Restricted + 4 External Teams\"] B[\"� SSH + VS Code Remote ConnectionCertificate-based Authentication\"] C[\"☁️ Azure VM (Standard D8s v3)8 vCPUs • 32GB RAM • Ubuntu 22.04\"] D[\"👤 Individual User Accountsuser1, user2, user3... user8\"] E[\"🐳 Shared Dev ContainerPython 3.12 + AutoGen + Azure CLIAll Dependencies Pre-installed\"] F[\"📂 Shared Development Resources• Project Repository• Datasets & Models• Configuration Files\"] G[\"✅ Results Achieved94% Faster Onboarding$400/month vs $16k laptopsEnhanced Security\"] A --> B B --> C C --> D D --> E E --> F F --> G style A fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2,stroke-width:3px,color:#000 style B fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:3px,color:#000 style C fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#0277bd,stroke-width:3px,color:#000 style D fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-width:3px,color:#000 style E fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:3px,color:#000 style F fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-width:3px,color:#000 style G fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:3px,color:#000 Lets check out how this was built and setup… The Deep Dive: How We Built ItStep 1: Provisioning the Azure VMWe started with a Linux VM in Azure. After some testing, we settled on a Standard D8s v3 instance (8 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM) which provided enough resources for all eight developers to work simultaneously without performance issues. 123456789# VM Creation (simplified for clarity)az vm create \\ --resource-group DevEnvironmentRG \\ --name SharedDevVM \\ --image Ubuntu2204 \\ --size Standard_D8s_v3 \\ --admin-username azureuser \\ --generate-ssh-keys \\ --public-ip-address-allocation static Step 2: User Account ArchitectureInstead of having everyone share a single account (security nightmare!), we created individual Linux user accounts for each developer. This approach gave us: Audit trails: We could track who did what and when Personalized environments: Each developer could customize their shell, aliases, and local configs Security isolation: Problems with one account wouldn’t affect others Resource monitoring: We could track resource usage per developer if needed Here’s how we automated user creation: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425#!/bin/bash# create_dev_users.shDEVELOPERS=(&quot;alice&quot; &quot;bob&quot; &quot;charlie&quot; &quot;david&quot; &quot;eve&quot; &quot;frank&quot; &quot;grace&quot; &quot;henry&quot;)for dev in &quot;${DEVELOPERS[@]}&quot;; do # Create user with home directory sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash $dev # Create .ssh directory sudo mkdir -p /home/$dev/.ssh sudo chmod 700 /home/$dev/.ssh # Set up for SSH key authentication sudo touch /home/$dev/.ssh/authorized_keys sudo chmod 600 /home/$dev/.ssh/authorized_keys # Set ownership sudo chown -R $dev:$dev /home/$dev/.ssh # Add to docker group (for container access) sudo usermod -aG docker $dev echo &quot;Created user: $dev&quot;done Step 3: Certificate-Based AuthenticationPassword authentication over the internet? Not on our watch. We implemented certificate-based SSH authentication for each developer: 1234# On each developer's local machinessh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &quot;developer@project&quot; -f ~/.ssh/project_dev_key# The public key was then added to their respective authorized_keys file on the VM The beauty of this approach: No passwords to remember or rotate Certificates could be revoked instantly if needed Multi-factor authentication could be added via Azure AD if required Worked seamlessly even from the restricted environment (SSH client was available) Step 4: VS Code Remote Development MagicThis is where the magic happened. VS Code’s Remote-SSH extension turned our Linux VM into a powerful development environment. Each developer configured their VS Code with: 123456// .ssh/config on developer machineHost azure-dev-vm HostName &lt;VM-PUBLIC-IP&gt; User alice IdentityFile ~/.ssh/project_dev_key ForwardAgent yes Once connected, developers had the full VS Code experience: IntelliSense working perfectly Debugging capabilities Extension support Integrated terminal Git integration But we didn’t stop there… Step 5: The Dev Container RevolutionHere’s where we went from “good” to “game-changing.” We created a Dev Container that encapsulated our entire development environment. This meant: No more “pip install” parties: Everything was pre-installedNo more version conflicts: Everyone used the exact same versionsNo more missing dependencies: If it worked for one, it worked for all Our .devcontainer/devcontainer.json: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Autogen Development Environment&quot;, &quot;image&quot;: &quot;mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:1-3.12-bullseye&quot;, &quot;features&quot;: { &quot;ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/anaconda:1&quot;: {}, &quot;ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/azure-cli:1&quot;: { &quot;version&quot;: &quot;latest&quot; }, &quot;ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker:1&quot;: { &quot;moby&quot;: true, &quot;installDockerBuildx&quot;: true, &quot;installDockerComposeSwitch&quot;: true, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;latest&quot;, &quot;dockerDashComposeVersion&quot;: &quot;v2&quot; }, &quot;ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/apt-get-packages:1&quot;: { &quot;packages&quot;: [ &quot;tig&quot; ] } }, &quot;customizations&quot;: { &quot;vscode&quot;: { &quot;extensions&quot;: [ &quot;github.copilot&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-docker&quot;, &quot;ms-python.python&quot;, &quot;ms-python.vscode-pylance&quot;, &quot;redhat.vscode-yaml&quot;, &quot;editorconfig.editorconfig&quot;, &quot;ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines&quot;, &quot;ms-azure-load-testing.microsoft-testing&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.azure-dev&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azurecontainerapps&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions&quot;, &quot;eamodio.gitlens&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azurelogicapps&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azurevirtualmachines&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-containers&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-cosmosdb&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-docker&quot;, &quot;ms-python.black-formatter&quot;, &quot;ms-python.debugpy&quot;, &quot;ms-python.isort&quot;, &quot;ms-python.pylint&quot;, &quot;ms-python.python&quot;, &quot;ms-python.vscode-pylance&quot;, &quot;ms-vscode.azure-repos&quot;, &quot;ms-vscode.azurecli&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.azure-dev&quot;, &quot;ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot&quot; ] } } // &quot;postCreateCommand&quot;: &quot;pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt&quot;,} Step 6: Shared Resources and CollaborationWith everyone working on the same VM, we could leverage shared resources effectively: 123456789101112# Shared directories for common resources/home/shared/├── datasets/ # Common datasets for AI training├── models/ # Shared model artifacts├── configs/ # Shared configuration files└── scripts/ # Utility scripts# Permissions set for group collaborationsudo groupadd developerssudo usermod -a -G developers alice bob charlie... # all developerssudo chown -R :developers /home/sharedsudo chmod -R 775 /home/shared The Unexpected Benefits1. Lightning-Fast OnboardingOur typical onboarding process used to take 2-3 days: Day 1: Install Python, configure environment Day 2: Debug dependency issues, version conflicts Day 3: Finally start actual development With our new setup: Hour 1: Receive SSH certificate and connection instructions Hour 2: Connect VS Code, open project in container Hour 3: Writing production code That’s a 94% reduction in onboarding time! 2. Compute Power DemocracyPreviously, developers with older laptops struggled with AI model training and testing. Now everyone had access to: 8 vCPUs for parallel processing 32 GB RAM for large datasets Fast SSD storage for quick I/O Azure’s network backbone for downloading models and datasets 3. Cost Optimization That Surprised FinanceOur finance team loved this approach: Traditional approach: 8 high-spec laptops = ~$16,000 Our approach: 1 Azure VM = ~$400/month Even accounting for the VM running 24/7, we saved money within the first year. 4. Security Without SufferingThe restricted environment developers could finally contribute without compromising security: No software installed on their local machines All code remained in the cloud Audit logs for every action Easy to revoke access when project ended Real-World Results: The AutoGen ProjectLet me share some specific wins from our AutoGen AI agent project: Development Velocity Before: 2-3 features per sprint (too much time on environment issues) After: 8-10 features per sprint (focus on actual development) Code Quality Before: “Works on my machine” was a daily phrase After: If it worked in the dev container, it worked everywhere Team Morale Before: Frustration with environment setup and restrictions After: Developers focused on solving interesting AI problems Specific AutoGen BenefitsWorking with AutoGen requires multiple AI models, API keys, and complex configurations. Our setup handled this beautifully: 12345678910111213141516# Shared configuration file accessible to all# /home/shared/configs/autogen_config.pyconfig_list = [ { &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4&quot;, &quot;api_key&quot;: os.environ.get(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;), }, { &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;, &quot;api_key&quot;: os.environ.get(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;), }]# Each developer could test with the same models and configurations# No &quot;I don't have API access&quot; blockers Lessons Learned and Best PracticesWhat Worked Well Start with more resources than you think you need: We initially tried a smaller VM and hit performance issues. Better to scale down than suffer with poor performance. Invest time in the Dev Container setup: Every hour spent perfecting the container saved days of debugging later. Document everything: We created a comprehensive wiki with: Connection instructions Troubleshooting guides Best practices for shared development Git workflow for the shared environment Regular backups: We automated daily backups of the entire VM and home directories. Challenges We Faced Concurrent file editing: We needed clear Git workflows to prevent conflicts Solution: Feature branches and frequent commits Resource contention: Occasionally, one developer’s process would hog resources Solution: Implemented resource limits using cgroups SSH connection drops: Some developers faced connection issues Solution: Configured SSH keep-alive and implemented tmux for session persistence Security ConsiderationsDon’t forget these crucial security aspects: 123456789101112# Implement fail2ban for SSH protectionsudo apt-get install fail2ban# Configure firewall rulessudo ufw allow from &lt;OFFICE_IP_RANGE&gt; to any port 22sudo ufw enable# Regular security updatessudo unattended-upgrades# Audit loggingsudo apt-get install auditd ConclusionWhat started as a desperate attempt to enable collaboration across restricted environments turned into a revolutionary approach to distributed development. By leveraging Azure VMs, Dev Containers, and VS Code Remote Development, we not only solved our immediate problem but discovered a solution that offers: 94% faster onboarding for new team members Significant cost savings compared to traditional hardware approaches Enhanced security without sacrificing developer productivity True collaboration through shared resources and environments Consistent development experience across all team members The key insight was recognizing that personal laptops could serve as the bridge between restricted corporate environments and cloud-based development infrastructure. Sometimes the best solutions come from thinking outside the traditional corporate IT box. Whether you’re dealing with similar restrictions or simply want to improve your team’s development experience, this architecture pattern could be the game-changer you’re looking for. The combination of Azure infrastructure, containerized development environments, and modern remote development tools creates a powerful platform that scales with your team’s needs.

Problem: No documented API exists for bulk updating searchable branches across thousands of repositories. Solution: Use the undocumented Policy Configuration API with policy type 0517f88d-4ec5-4343-9d26-9930ebd53069 to programmatically add branches to the searchable list. This approach leverages the same API calls the Azure DevOps UI uses internally, enabling automation of what would otherwise require manual configuration across massive repository collections. Recently, I encountered an interesting challenge while working on a JFrog Artifactory adoption tracking project across a large Azure DevOps organization. The requirement was to scan repositories for JFrog URL references to determine which teams had successfully onboarded to their new artifact management system. The problem? Some development teams exclusively work in develop branches instead of master or main, and Azure DevOps code search only indexes the default branch by default. This seemingly simple requirement - adding develop to the searchable branches for thousands of repositories - turned into a fascinating exploration of Azure DevOps’ undocumented APIs. While there’s no official documentation for bulk updating searchable branches, I discovered that the Azure DevOps UI uses a specific Policy Configuration API under the hood that we can leverage for automation. This blog post shares a practical approach to programmatically configure searchable branches across large Azure DevOps organizations using REST APIs that Microsoft doesn’t officially document but absolutely supports. The Challenge: Azure DevOps Code Search LimitationsAzure DevOps code search is a powerful feature, but it comes with a significant limitation that affects many organizations: by default, only the repository’s default branch (typically master or main) is indexed for search operations. This creates problems in several scenarios: JFrog Adoption Tracking: Organizations implementing JFrog Artifactory need to scan all repositories for configuration files and dependency references, but teams using feature branches or develop as their primary branch won’t be detected. Multi-Branch Development: Teams practicing GitFlow or similar branching strategies may have critical code in develop, release/*, or feature branches that needs to be searchable. Compliance and Security Scanning: Security tools and compliance scripts that rely on code search may miss important files if they’re not in the default branch. Understanding Azure DevOps Searchable BranchesIn Azure DevOps, searchable branches are configured at the repository level through the UI: Manual Configuration Path: Navigate to Project Settings → Repositories Select your repository Go to Settings → Searchable Branches Add additional branches (maximum of 5 extra branches) What Actually Happens:When you configure searchable branches through the UI, Azure DevOps creates or updates a policy configuration with a specific policy type. This policy type - 0517f88d-4ec5-4343-9d26-9930ebd53069 - controls which branches are indexed for code search. The Discovery: Hidden Policy Configuration APIAfter extensive research and reverse engineering the Azure DevOps UI network traffic, I discovered that searchable branch configuration is managed through the Policy Configuration API with a specific, undocumented policy type. Key Insights: Azure DevOps doesn’t expose a direct “searchable branches” API endpoint The UI uses the Policy Configuration API with policy type 0517f88d-4ec5-4343-9d26-9930ebd53069 This API is officially supported but not documented for this specific use case The same approach works for both Azure DevOps Server and Azure DevOps Cloud The Solution: Automated Policy ConfigurationThe approach involves three main steps: Step 1: Retrieve Existing Policy ConfigurationFirst, we need to check if a searchable branches policy already exists for the repository: 123456789# Get existing searchable branch policy for a repository$policyUrl = &quot;https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/policy/configurations&quot;$params = @{ 'repositoryId' = $repositoryId 'policyType' = '0517f88d-4ec5-4343-9d26-9930ebd53069' 'api-version' = '7.1-preview.1'}$existingPolicy = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $policyUrl -Headers $headers -Method Get -Body $params Step 2: Create or Update Policy ConfigurationIf a policy exists, we update it. If not, we create a new one: 12345678910111213141516171819202122# Policy configuration for searchable branches$policySettings = @{ 'type' = @{ 'id' = '0517f88d-4ec5-4343-9d26-9930ebd53069' } 'isEnabled' = $true 'isBlocking' = $false 'settings' = @{ 'searchBranches' = @( 'refs/heads/master', 'refs/heads/main', 'refs/heads/develop' ) } 'scope' = @( @{ 'repositoryId' = $repositoryId 'refName' = 'refs/heads/master' 'matchKind' = 'exact' } )} Step 3: Apply the ConfigurationSend the policy configuration to Azure DevOps: 12345678910if ($existingPolicy.count -gt 0) { # Update existing policy $configId = $existingPolicy.value[0].id $updateUrl = &quot;https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/policy/configurations/$configId&quot;

Indexing Delays: After updating searchable branches, Azure DevOps may take several hours to index the new branches. Search results won’t be immediately available. Performance ConsiderationsRate Limiting: Implement appropriate delays between API calls to avoid hitting rate limits, especially when processing thousands of repositories. Batch Processing: For large organizations, consider processing repositories in batches and implementing retry logic for failed requests. Error HandlingRepository States: Some repositories may not have branches configured or may be in archived states. Implement proper error handling for these scenarios. Permission Issues: Ensure your Personal Access Token has sufficient permissions for policy configuration (Project Settings, Read &amp; Manage). Authentication and Security SetupPersonal Access Token ConfigurationCreate a Personal Access Token with the following permissions: Code (Read) - To access repository information Project and Team (Read) - To list projects and repositories Policy Configuration (Read &amp; Manage) - To update searchable branch policies Security Best PracticesToken Storage: Store Personal Access Tokens securely and rotate them regularly according to your organization’s security policies. Least Privilege: Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions for automation scripts. Audit Logging: Log all policy changes for compliance and troubleshooting purposes. Advanced Usage ScenariosConditional Branch ConfigurationConfigure different searchable branches based on repository naming conventions or team requirements: 12345678910111213141516171819202122# Example: Configure different branches based on repository name patterns$branchConfig = @{ 'web-*' = @('master', 'develop', 'staging') 'api-*' = @('master', 'develop', 'release') 'mobile-*' = @('master', 'develop', 'feature/*')}foreach ($repo in $repositories.value) { $branches = @('master', 'main') # Default branches # Add specific branches based on repository name foreach ($pattern in $branchConfig.Keys) { if ($repo.name -like $pattern) { $branches += $branchConfig[$pattern] break } } # Remove duplicates and configure $uniqueBranches = $branches | Select-Object -Unique Update-SearchableBranches -repositoryId $repo.id -branches $uniqueBranches} Integration with CI/CD PipelinesIntegrate searchable branch configuration into your DevOps workflows: 12345678# Azure DevOps Pipeline example- task: PowerShell@2 displayName: 'Configure Searchable Branches' inputs: targetType: 'inline' script: | # Your PowerShell script here # Use pipeline variables for organization, project, and PAT Troubleshooting Common IssuesPolicy Configuration Not FoundIf the GET request returns empty results, the repository may not have searchable branches configured yet. Create a new policy instead of updating an existing one. Invalid Branch ReferencesEnsure branch names use the correct format: Correct: refs/heads/develop Incorrect: develop or origin/develop Permission Denied ErrorsVerify that your Personal Access Token has the required permissions and that you have administrative access to the project. Indexing DelaysAfter configuration, search indexing may take several hours. Test with small repositories first to verify the configuration is working before processing large numbers of repositories.

Key TakeawaysWorking with Azure DevOps searchable branches requires understanding the underlying Policy Configuration API that Microsoft uses internally but doesn’t officially document for this purpose. The key insights from this solution are: Hidden APIs Exist: Azure DevOps has powerful APIs that aren’t always documented for every use case UI Reverse Engineering: Network traffic analysis can reveal API patterns for automation Policy-Based Configuration: Many Azure DevOps features use the Policy Configuration API under the hood Batch Processing Considerations: Large-scale automation requires careful attention to rate limiting and error handling This solution provides a robust foundation for any Azure DevOps organization needing to manage searchable branches at scale. Whether you’re tracking technology adoption, performing security scanning, or implementing code quality initiatives, this approach enables the automation that makes these tasks feasible across large repository collections. The undocumented nature of this API means it should be used with appropriate caution and monitoring, but for organizations with thousands of repositories, it’s currently the only viable approach for bulk searchable branch configuration.

This post demonstrates how to keep your data in your compliant region (e.g., New Zealand North) while leveraging Microsoft Foundry in another region (e.g., Australia East) purely for AI inferencing. Using cross-region Private Endpoints over Azure’s backbone network, applications securely access Foundry’s AI capabilities without data traversing the public internet—maintaining both regional compliance and zero-trust security posture. The Solution: All data at rest, applications, and Private Endpoints remain in NZN. Microsoft Foundry deployed in AUE provides AI inferencing only. Private connectivity ensures secure, compliant architecture across regions. When deploying Microsoft Foundry (formerly Azure AI Foundry) in enterprise environments, you’ll face a critical constraint: Microsoft Foundry isn’t available in every Azure region, yet data residency requirements mandate that all data at rest remains within specific regions. Imagine this scenario: Your organization must keep all data in New Zealand North due to regulatory compliance, but Microsoft Foundry is only available in Australia East. You can’t move data to AUE, but you need Foundry’s AI capabilities. How do you maintain compliance while accessing AI inferencing services? The solution is architectural: Keep all data at rest in your compliant region (NZN) and use Microsoft Foundry in the available region (AUE) purely for AI inferencing. By deploying cross-region Private Endpoints, applications in NZN securely access Foundry’s AI services over Azure’s backbone network—no public internet, no data residency violations, no compromises. This guide walks through the complete architecture, DNS configuration, security considerations, and implementation steps for deploying this cross-region private endpoint pattern. ⚠️ Important: Foundry Agents Service Limitation If you plan to use the Foundry Agents service specifically, there is a known limitation at the time of writing: all Foundry workspace resources (Cosmos DB, Storage Account, AI Search, Foundry Account, Project, Managed Identity, Azure OpenAI, or other Foundry resources used for model deployments) must be deployed in the same region as the VNet. This means the cross-region pattern described in this post will not work for Foundry Agents deployments—you would need to deploy everything in the same region (e.g., all resources in Australia East where Foundry is available). However, if you are NOT using the Foundry Agents service (i.e., you’re only using Foundry for AI inferencing via API calls—OpenAI models, Speech Services, Vision, etc.), then the cross-region private endpoint pattern works perfectly, and all your data can reside in your chosen compliant region as described in this post.

Think of it as a comprehensive AI studio environment where developers can build, evaluate, and deploy generative AI applications without the complexity of stitching together multiple Azure services manually. Why Foundry Matters for Enterprise AIFoundry provides several enterprise-grade capabilities out of the box: Unified AI Platform: Instead of managing separate Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services, and ML resources, Foundry consolidates these into a single managed environment with consistent APIs and management experiences. Enterprise Security &amp; Compliance: Built-in support for managed identities, RBAC, audit logging, and network isolation ensures your AI applications meet corporate security requirements. Observability &amp; Monitoring: Integrated tracing, logging, and monitoring capabilities help you understand how your AI applications are performing and troubleshoot issues quickly. Development Productivity: A unified development experience through Azure AI Studio portal and SDKs accelerates AI application development by reducing integration overhead. Because Foundry encapsulates many Azure AI services and provides such comprehensive capabilities, it has specific networking requirements when you want to integrate it into a secure, enterprise cloud environment. This is where Private Endpoints become critical. Azure Private Endpoints: The Foundation of Secure ConnectivityAn Azure Private Endpoint is essentially a network interface (NIC) with a private IP address from your Azure Virtual Network that connects privately to a supported Azure service. When you create a private endpoint for a service like Foundry, you’re bringing that service into your VNet’s address space, allowing VNet resources to reach the service via an internal IP address instead of traversing the public internet. How Private Link Works Under the HoodAzure Private Link is the technology that makes Private Endpoints possible. Here’s what happens when you enable private connectivity: Private IP Assignment: A network interface is created in your VNet subnet with a private IP (e.g., 10.1.2.4) DNS Resolution: The service’s FQDN (e.g., myFoundry.cognitiveservices.azure.com) is configured to resolve to the private IP instead of the public endpoint Backbone Network Transit: Traffic between your VNet and the service travels entirely on Microsoft’s backbone network, never touching public internet routes Regional Flexibility: The private endpoint can be in a different region than the target service, enabling cross-region private connectivity Key Benefits of Private EndpointsEnhanced Security: Traffic never leaves Azure’s internal network, eliminating internet-based attack vectors and data exfiltration risks. Supported Across Azure PaaS: Many Azure services support private endpoints including Storage accounts, SQL databases, Cosmos DB, Cognitive Services (which Foundry uses), Key Vault, and more. Cross-Region Capability: Critically, Azure allows the private endpoint’s NIC to reside in a different region than the service’s region. The private endpoint must be in the same region as the VNet you place it in, but the target resource can be in any Azure region. This is the key feature that enables our solution. DNS Integration: Azure Private DNS Zones provide seamless name resolution, making private endpoint connectivity transparent to applications. DNS Configuration RequirementsUsing a private endpoint requires configuring DNS so that the service’s FQDN resolves to the private IP instead of the public IP. For Azure Cognitive Services (which Foundry is built on), this typically involves: Creating a Private DNS Zone: privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com Linking the zone to your VNets Adding an A record mapping the Foundry hostname to the private endpoint IP Without proper DNS configuration, clients will continue resolving the public IP address and bypass the private link entirely, defeating the purpose of the security setup. The Cross-Region Challenge: When Foundry Isn’t Available LocallyUnderstanding the Regional Availability ProblemMicrosoft Foundry is not yet available in every Azure region. At the time of writing, Foundry has limited regional availability as Microsoft continues rolling out the service globally. This creates a common scenario for many organizations: The Scenario: Let’s imagine an organization with Azure infrastructure primarily deployed in New Zealand North (NZN) – perhaps due to data residency requirements, latency optimization for local users, or established governance policies. However, Microsoft Foundry is only available in Australia East (AUE), with New Zealand North not yet on the supported regions list. The Challenge: The organization needs to leverage Foundry’s powerful AI capabilities while maintaining private network connectivity and keeping all traffic within the Azure environment. Simply deploying everything in Australia East isn’t feasible due to data residency requirements etc. So all data at rest needs to be in New Zealand North region. Microsoft Foundry will be used for AI inferencing only and all data at rest must remain in New Zealand North. Why Standard Approaches Don’t WorkLet’s consider the typical alternatives and why they fall short: Deploy Everything in AUE: This requires relocating or duplicating existing infrastructure, increasing costs and complexity. Data residency requirements may prohibit this approach entirely. Use Public Endpoints: Exposing Foundry via public endpoints contradicts enterprise zero-trust security policies and increases attack surface unnecessarily. Accept Regional Limitations: Waiting for Foundry to become available in your region delays AI initiatives and competitive advantages. The Solution: Cross-Region Private EndpointsThe solution leverages Azure’s support for cross-region Private Endpoints. By deploying a Private Endpoint in your New Zealand North VNet that connects to the Foundry service in Australia East, you achieve several critical outcomes: Private Connectivity: All traffic between NZN and AUE travels on Azure’s backbone network Regional Compliance: Resources remain in their designated regions with private interconnection Transparent Access: Applications in NZN access Foundry as if it’s a local service via private IP Security Posture: Foundry’s public endpoints can be disabled, enforcing private-only access Architecture Deep Dive: Cross-Region Foundry DeploymentHigh-Level Architecture OverviewThe architecture deploys Microsoft Foundry in Australia East while enabling secure access from resources in New Zealand North. Here’s how the components fit together: Foundry Service (Australia East): The actual Microsoft Foundry resource deployed in AUE, configured as a Cognitive Services account with AI capabilities enabled. Private Endpoint (New Zealand North): A network interface in your NZN VNet with a private IP address (e.g., 10.1.2.4) that acts as the gateway to the AUE Foundry service. Private DNS Zone: A DNS zone (privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com) linked to your VNets that resolves the Foundry FQDN to the private endpoint IP. Client Applications (New Zealand North): VMs, App Services, containers, or other resources in NZN that consume the Foundry APIs. sequenceDiagram participant C as 👤 Client10.1.1.10 participant D as 🔐 Private DNS participant P as 🔒 Private EP10.1.2.4 participant B as 🌐 Public Internet participant F as 🤖 Foundry(AUE) rect rgb(227, 242, 253) Note over C,D: New Zealand North Region end rect rgb(232, 245, 232) Note over F: Australia East Region end C->>D: 1.

All the cross-region complexity is abstracted by Azure’s networking layer. Critical Architectural ConsiderationsAzure Backbone Network TransitThe connection between NZN and AUE is entirely internal to Azure. No traffic exits to the public internet, even though the regions are geographically separated across the Tasman Sea. Azure’s global backbone network handles the routing, ensuring: Security: Traffic never traverses public networks Reliability: Azure’s backbone offers higher SLAs than internet routes Performance: Optimized routing between Azure datacenters Private DNS Resolution RequirementsDNS configuration is the linchpin that makes private endpoints work correctly. Microsoft Foundry (AIServices kind) requires multiple Private DNS zones for full functionality: Required Private DNS Zones: privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com - Primary Cognitive Services endpoint privatelink.openai.azure.com - Azure OpenAI service endpoints privatelink.services.ai.azure.com - AI Foundry management endpoints Configuration Steps: DNS Zone Creation: Create all required Private DNS zones in your subscription VNet Linking: Link the DNS zones to your NZN VNet (and any other VNets that need access) A Record Mapping: Azure automatically creates the necessary A records when using DNS zone groups with private endpoints, or you can manually add A records for your Foundry resource pointing to the private endpoint IP Multi-VNet Scenarios: If you have separate VNets (e.g., hub-and-spoke topology), ensure all VNets are linked to the DNS zones or use DNS forwarding Without proper DNS configuration across all zones, clients will resolve public IPs and bypass your private endpoint entirely, rendering the security setup ineffective. Performance and Latency ImplicationsWhile traffic stays private, the cross-region architecture introduces additional latency: Typical Latency: NZN to AUE is a trans-Tasman hop, usually adding 30-60ms compared to in-region calls Acceptable Use Cases: Most AI API calls (text generation, embeddings, etc.) can tolerate this latency Latency-Sensitive Workloads: Real-time voice applications or ultra-low-latency requirements may need careful evaluation Bandwidth Charges: Azure charges for cross-region data transfer. Egress from AUE to NZN incurs bandwidth costs. Budget accordingly for high-volume scenarios. Security Posture EnhancementPrivate Endpoints enable several security improvements: Disable Public Access: Configure Foundry to reject all public network connections, forcing traffic through approved private endpoints Network Security Groups (NSGs): Apply NSGs to the private endpoint subnet to control which source IPs can reach the Foundry service Azure Firewall Integration: Route private endpoint traffic through Azure Firewall for additional inspection and logging On-Premises Connectivity: If you have ExpressRoute or VPN connecting on-premises to Azure, those networks can also access Foundry privately through the NZN VNet Step-by-Step Implementation Overview ⚠️ Important: Choose Your Own Unique Name The name myFoundryDemo used throughout these examples is already taken in Azure’s global namespace. Cognitive Services accounts require globally unique names across all Azure subscriptions worldwide. Before running any commands below: Replace myFoundryDemo with your own unique name (e.g., myFoundryProd2025, contoso-ai-foundry, etc.) in all the Azure CLI commands. This name will become part of your endpoint URL: &lt;your-unique-name&gt;.cognitiveservices.azure.com The following sections walk through the high-level steps to implement this architecture. Part 2 will provide detailed scripts and Infrastructure-as-Code templates.

Microsoft Foundry requires multiple Private DNS zones: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546# Create all required Private DNS Zones for Microsoft Foundryaz network private-dns zone create \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --name privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.comaz network private-dns zone create \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --name privatelink.openai.azure.comaz network private-dns zone create \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --name privatelink.services.ai.azure.com# Link DNS zones to VNetfor zone in &quot;privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com&quot; &quot;privatelink.openai.azure.com&quot; &quot;privatelink.services.ai.azure.com&quot;do az network private-dns link vnet create \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --zone-name $zone \\ --name &quot;link-vnet-nzn-main-${zone%%.azure.com}&quot; \\ --virtual-network vnet-nzn-main \\ --registration-enabled falsedone# Alternative: Use DNS Zone Group for automatic configuration# This automatically creates A records in all required zonesaz network private-endpoint dns-zone-group create \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --endpoint-name pe-foundry-nzn \\ --name default \\ --private-dns-zone privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com \\ --zone-name cognitiveservicesaz network private-endpoint dns-zone-group add \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --endpoint-name pe-foundry-nzn \\ --name default \\ --private-dns-zone privatelink.openai.azure.com \\ --zone-name openaiaz network private-endpoint dns-zone-group add \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --endpoint-name pe-foundry-nzn \\ --name default \\ --private-dns-zone privatelink.services.ai.azure.com \\ --zone-name aiservices DNS Configuration Options: Option 1 - DNS Zone Groups (Recommended): Using DNS zone groups (shown above) automatically creates and maintains A records in all zones. This is the preferred approach as Azure manages the DNS records lifecycle. Option 2 - Manual A Records: If you need manual control, get the private endpoint IP and create A records manually: 123456789101112# Get private endpoint IPPE_IP=$(az network private-endpoint show \\ --name pe-foundry-nzn \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --query 'customDnsConfigs[0].ipAddresses[0]' -o tsv)# Create DNS A record in the primary zoneaz network private-dns record-set a add-record \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --zone-name privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com \\ --record-set-name myFoundryDemo \\ --ipv4-address $PE_IP DNS Verification: All DNS zones must be created and linked to VNets needing access DNS zone groups automatically handle A record creation and updates For manual records, ensure the record name matches your Foundry resource name Multi-VNet deployments require linking all zones to each VNet Step 5: Test Private ConnectivityDeploy a test VM in the NZN VNet and verify connectivity: 12345678910111213141516# Create test VMaz vm create \\ --resource-group rg-networking-nzn \\ --name vm-test-nzn \\ --location newzealandnorth \\ --vnet-name vnet-nzn-main \\ --subnet snet-apps \\ --image Ubuntu2204 \\ --admin-username azureuser \\ --generate-ssh-keys# SSH to VM and test DNS resolutionssh azureuser@&lt;vm-public-ip&gt;# Verify DNS resolves to private IPnslookup myFoundryDemo.cognitiveservices.azure.com Expected DNS Output: 123456Server: 10.1.0.4Address: 10.1.0.4#53Name: myFoundryDemo.privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.comAddress: 10.1.2.4Aliases: myFoundryDemo.cognitiveservices.azure.com The resolution to 10.1.2.4 (private IP) confirms DNS is working correctly. Test API Connectivity: 123456# Get Foundry API key (from Azure portal or CLI)API_KEY=&quot;your-foundry-api-key&quot;# Test API callcurl -X GET &quot;https://myFoundryDemo.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/deployments?api-version=2024-02-01&quot; \\ -H &quot;api-key: $API_KEY&quot; If you receive a valid response (list of deployments or empty array), private connectivity is working. If you disabled public access on Foundry, this same curl command from your local machine should fail with a network error. Step 6: Lock Down Public AccessWith private connectivity confirmed, enhance security by disabling public access: 12345# Disable public network accessaz cognitiveservices account update \\ --name myFoundryDemo \\ --resource-group rg-foundry-aue \\ --public-network-access Disabled Additional Security Hardening: Apply NSGs to the private endpoint subnet restricting source IPs Enable Azure Firewall for additional traffic inspection Configure diagnostic logs to monitor access patterns Use managed identities instead of API keys for authentication Real-World Considerations and Trade-OffsCost ImplicationsCross-Region Data Transfer: Azure charges for data egress between regions. For NZN ↔ AUE, expect approximately $0.02-0.05 per GB transferred (approx pricing at the time of this writing). Monitor your Foundry usage patterns and budget accordingly. Private Endpoint Costs: Private endpoints incur a small hourly charge plus data processing charges per GB. Foundry Service Costs: The Foundry service itself has per-transaction or per-token costs depending on the AI services used (OpenAI, Speech, etc.). Latency ConsiderationsBaseline Latency: Expect 30-60ms additional latency for cross-region calls compared to in-region Impact Assessment: For most AI workloads (text generation, embeddings, document analysis), this latency is acceptable Optimization Strategies: Use async/await patterns to parallelize independent API calls Implement request batching where applicable Cache frequently-requested results Consider regional caching layers for static content On-Premises IntegrationIf your organization has on-premises datacenters connected to Azure via ExpressRoute or Site-to-Site VPN, you can extend private connectivity to those environments: DNS ForwardingConfigure on-premises DNS servers to forward queries for *.cognitiveservices.azure.com to Azure’s DNS resolvers: 12345# Example BIND configurationzone &quot;cognitiveservices.azure.com&quot; { type forward; forwarders { 10.1.0.4; }; # Azure VNet DNS server}; Network ConnectivityEnsure your on-premises network has routes to the NZN VNet where the private endpoint resides: ExpressRoute: Private peering enables private IP connectivity Site-to-Site VPN: VPN gateway provides encrypted connectivity Route Tables: Verify routes exist for the private endpoint subnet (10.1.2.0/24) With proper DNS and routing configuration, on-premises applications can access Foundry privately through the Azure backbone network. Cleanup ResourcesIf you’re finished testing and want to remove all resources created in this guide, you can delete the resource groups: 12345678910111213# Delete the networking resource group in New Zealand North# This removes the VNet, subnets, private endpoint, DNS zones, and test VMaz group delete \\ --name rg-networking-nzn \\ --yes \\ --no-wait# Delete the Foundry resource group in Australia East# This removes the Microsoft Foundry (Cognitive Services) accountaz group delete \\ --name rg-foundry-aue \\ --yes \\ --no-wait Important Notes: The --yes flag skips confirmation prompts The --no-wait flag allows the command to return immediately without waiting for deletion to complete Resource group deletion is permanent and cannot be undone Deletion can take several minutes; you can check status in the Azure portal or with az group show Wrapping Up Part 1This architecture solves a critical challenge: Microsoft Foundry isn’t available in all Azure regions, but data residency requirements often mandate that data at rest remains within specific regions. The solution demonstrated here keeps all data at rest in New Zealand North (your region of choice), while leveraging Microsoft Foundry in Australia East purely for AI inferencing capabilities. By deploying Private Endpoints in the NZN region, applications access Foundry’s AI services securely over Azure’s backbone network without any data ever traversing the public internet. Key Takeaway: Data stays in your compliant region (NZN), AI inferencing happens in the Foundry region (AUE), and all communication flows privately through Azure’s backbone. This pattern works for any region pair where Foundry availability doesn’t align with your data residency requirements. In Part 2, we’ll look at Infrastructure-as-Code templates using Bicep and Terraform to automate this deployment. References Microsoft Docs – What is Azure AI Foundry?

Problem: Serverless microservices accessible directly bypassing API Management security policies. Solution: IP restriction-based security using APIM’s public IP address to whitelist only API Management access, configuring both main site and SCM site restrictions. Architecture includes Azure Front Door for WAF capabilities since APIM Standard lacks native WAF protection. Here is a scenario that I recently encountered. Imagine we are building micro-services using serverless (a mix on Azure Function Apps and Logic Apps) with APIM in the front. Lets say we went with the APIM standard instance and all the logic and function apps are going to be running on consumption plan (for cost reasons as its cheaper). This means we wont be getting any vnet capability and our function and logic apps will be exposed out to the world (remember to get vnet with APIM we have to go with the premium version, we are going APIM standard here for cost saving reasons). So how do we restrict our function and logic apps to only go through the APIM, in another words all our function and logic apps must only go through the APIM and if anyone tries to access them directly they should be getting a “HTTP 403 Forbidden”. Lets visualize this scenario; We have some WAF capable ingress endpoint, in this case its Azure Front Door, that is forwarding traffic to APIM which then sends the requests to the serverless apps.Reason for having Front Door before APIM is because APIM doesn’t have WAF natively so we will need to put something in front of it that has that capability to be secure. There are few options like Azure Firewall, Application Gateway etc, but for the purposes of this scenario we have Azure Front Door in front of APIM (and we can have an APIM policy that will only accept traffic from Azure Font Door, we wont be going in to that, we will keep it to securing our function apps to just being available via APIM for today) Securing the function app First we will need to get the public ip address of the APIM White-list this address in our function app network restrictions Getting the public ip of APIMYou can go to the APIM resource in the Azure portal and get it from there Or you can use the CLI and run 1az apim show --name &quot;apim-name&quot; --resource-group &quot;resource-group-name&quot; White-listing the function app You need to go into networking -&gt; access restriction Only allow the APIM ip (once you enter this, the deny all will automatically come ie: all other ip’s are denied) Its important that the SCM site is also blocked. More about Kudu service that powers the SCM site here What happens if you try to access this functionNow its all blocked we get a nice HTTP 403 Forbidden What about deploying code to this function via GitHub ActionsWhen you try to deploy to these functions using GitHub Actions or even via Azure Devops you will get the same HTTP 403 and wont be able to deploy. This is because the GitHub runner’s ip address will be blocked; remember we are only allowing APIM in, all others are blocked. There are a couple of ways to get around this. I talk about this in the next post, you can check it out here References Cover image has been taken from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/#overview","link":"/Azure/Function-Apps/Security/securing-azure-functions-and-logic-apps/"},{"title":"Deploying To IP Restricted Azure Function Apps Using GitHub Actions","text":"🎯 TL;DR: Dynamic IP Management for CI/CD to Secured Azure Functions IP-restricted Function Apps block GitHub Actions runners causing HTTP 403 deployment failures since runners use dynamic IP addresses. Problem: Cannot whitelist entire GitHub IP range due to frequent changes. Solution: Dynamic IP management in GitHub Actions workflow using Azure CLI to temporarily add runner IP to SCM site access restrictions, deploy code, then remove IP. Implementation uses ipify API for IP detection, --use-same-restrictions-for-scm-site false for SCM isolation, and automated cleanup to maintain security posture. In the previous post we blocked our function app to be available only to the APIM via ip restrictions. This secures our function app and it isn’t available publicly, any one that tries to access our function app url will get “HTTP 403 Forbidden”. This secures our function app; now what about deploying code changes to the function app via GitHub Actions? we should be able to CI/CD to our function app, but there is a problem here. The GitHub action will fail with the same “HTTP 403 Forbidden”, this is because GitHub actions run on runners (its a hosted virtual environment), each time we run the Action we get a new runner and it can have a different ip address. So how can we get around this? do we white list the entire GitHub ip range? GitHub’s ip ranges can change any time, so will have to keep scanning for changes to these ranges and proactively update our ip restrictions, this is not very scalable or practical. So what are other ways of getting around this? we have a couple of ways to get around this. Possible SolutionsThere are two viable solutions here 1. Use a self-hosted runner Where you bring your own VM’s with static ip’s and whitelist these static ip’s Pros: Full control over your devops agents Can optimize/reuse these agents for various CI/CD workloads for your cloud and on-prem deployments Cons: You have to provision and maintain your own VM’s, there will be time and effort required for this Extra costs to maintain your own VM(s), although this could be optimized by turning them off after hours etc You miss out on the free GitHub Action minutes you get Extra work of provisioning VM’s, installing all the tooling for builds, maintaining and paying for them 2. Do some extra steps in the existing GitHub Actions Use the Azure CLI Do an az login Grab the public ip of the GitHub runner, you could use a simple public api like the ipify api to grab the public ip of the Github Runner Use az cli to update ip restriction to add this additional ip Do-your-normal-Deployment Use az cli to remove the ip added in step 4 Pros: You use the same GitHub runner and workflow No effort in provisioning or maintaining extra virtual machines yourself Little bit of extra code is all that is needed Cons: There is a possibility that the GitHub action runner fails/crashes after doing step 4 but before it had a chance to get to step 5, you could be left with an extra ip address white listed in your app until you run the workflow again. This post is all about how to go about doing option 2 (do some extra steps in the existing GitHub Actions), although there is one con (ie: the GitHub runner crashing during step 5 and leaving an ip address of the runner there), in my view this is a very small risk. The chances of a crash precisely at that point are low and even it does happen the risk of having the runner ip (only 1 extra ip) for a short duration until your next run happens is very low. Show me the codeIf you want to skip and just get to the code: Here is the sample hello world function app (written in .net 6) Here is the GitHub Action that is deploying to ip restricted app In the above GitHub Action it is deploying a hello world function app; it is doing a dotnet build, package and deploy. Those are all the standard bits of deploying a function app; lets go over the interesting bits Getting the GitHub Runners public ip Whitelisting this ip After a successful deploy of our app, we remove the ip added in step 2 For the first step we are using a public package haythem/public-ip@v1.2 to get the ip. We can also manually do a curl our &gt;selves to the ipify api and grab the public ip ourselves. For the purposes of this demo we will use this package. Step 1 - getting the GitHub runners public ip 123- name: Public IP id: ip uses: haythem/public-ip@v1.2 Next for the second step we use the az cli to add the ip address. First we use az webapp config to set the –use-same-restrictions-for-scm-site false, here we are saying don’t apply the same restriction as the main site to the scm site Our main site is still safe with the right ip restrictions, our scm site is now ready for changes Next we use az functionapp config access-restriction to add the GitHub runner ip to just the scm site Step 2 - white listing the GitHub runner’s public ip 1234567- name: 'Allow Github Runner IpAddress' uses: azure/CLI@v1 with: azcliversion: 2.37.0 inlineScript: | az webapp config access-restriction set -g $ -n func-app-iprest-demo --use-same-restrictions-for-scm-site false az functionapp config access-restriction add -g $ -n func-app-iprest-demo --rule-name github_runner --action Allow --ip-address $ --priority 100 --scm-site true Finally we remove the ip address we added from the previous step and set the scm site access the same as our main site Step 3 - after successful deploy, remove the GitHub runner’s public ip 1234567- name: 'Remove Github Runner IpAddress' uses: azure/CLI@v1 with: azcliversion: 2.37.0 inlineScript: | az functionapp config access-restriction remove -g $ -n func-app-iprest-demo --rule-name github_runner --scm-site true az webapp config access-restriction set -g $ -n func-app-iprest-demo --use-same-restrictions-for-scm-site true Finally 👏! we can now deploy using GitHub Actions to ip restricted function apps 🙌.

Problem: Traditional ingress controllers add network hops and consume AKS compute resources. Solution: Application Gateway routes directly to pod IPs via Azure Resource Manager integration, offering WAF, SSL termination, and managed updates as AKS add-on. Critical limitation: 100 backend pool limit means 2000+ services require 20 Application Gateways, making cost-effective deployment challenging for large-scale clusters. Recently I ran into an interesting issue with an AKS cluster running 2000+ services. There is nothing wrong in running 2000+ services that’s what Kubernetes is there for, scale! but the interesting aspect that caught my attention was trying to get the Applicaiton Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) to ingress to all these services. I had worked with Istio and NGINX for ingress into AKS with no issues and never AGIC, so I had to try this to see where it worked well, what the advantages are and where the limitations are. Application GatewayApplication Gateway (App Gateway) is a well-established layer 7 service that has been around for a while, some of the major features are: URL routing Cookie-based affinity SSL termination End-to-end SSL Support for public, private, and hybrid web sites Integrated web application firewall Zone redundancy Connection draining This post isn’t focused on the App Gateway itself, it’s more about how and what it can do as an ingress controller for AKS. You can find out more about App Gateway and all abouts its features here TLDR;Benefits of AGIC Direct connection to the pods without an extra hop, this results in a performance benefit up to 50% lower network latency compared to in-cluster ingress Could make a huge difference in performance and latency sensitive applications and workloads If going the AKS add-on route then it becomes fully managed and updated In cluster ingress consumes and competes for AKS compute/memory resources where was with App Gateway separated from the cluster it won’t be leeching any of the AKS compute Full benefits of the Application Gateway such as WAF, cookie-based affinity, ssl termination amongst many others Limitations Application Gateway has some backend limits. Backend pools are limited to 100. Application Gateway does have a pricing implication Routing is directly to pod IP’s rather than the ClusterIP of the service. There is a feature request open for this Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC)AGIC went to GA around the end of 2019 and offered the possibilities of hooking up an App Gateway as an attractive alternative for ingress into an AKS cluster. Before moving any further with AGIC, we need to understand at a high-level how networking works in AKS. There are two main network models: Kubenet networking Default option for Kubernetes out of the box Each Node receives an IP from the Azure virtual network subnet Pods in the node are not associated to the Azure vnet, they are assigned an IP address from the PodIPCidr and a route table is created by AKS Azure Container Networking Interface networking (CNI) Each pod itself receives an IPaddress from the Azure virtual network subnet Pods can be directly reached via their private IP from connected networks Pods can access resources in the vnet directly with out issues (e.g.: function app in the same vnet) It’s important to note, once you create an AKS cluster with a given network model you can’t change it; you will have to create a new one. There are advantages and disadvantages in both models which are listed in detail in this link. One key consideration to highlight is: Kubenet - /24 IP range can support up to 251 nodes (each subnet reserves the first 3 IP addresses for management operations). Given the maximum nodes per pod in Kubenet is 110, this configuration can support a maximum of 251 * 110 = 27,610 pods CNI - the same /24 IP range can support a maximum of 8 nodes (CNI has a max of thirty pods per node). So, this configuration can support a maximum of 240 When it comes to CNI you will have to plan for the IP addresses, you might need to a /16 range to get a bigger node count. There are also limitations with the kubenet that will need to be taken into consideration. With the AKS networking models out of the way, let’s look at AGIC; regardless of which model is chosen, the goal for AGIC is to ingress directly to the pod, a simple representation of this can be seen below. AGIC when deployed, runs in a pod in the AKS cluster and watches for changes, when changes are detected (i.e.: a new pod has been added or existing pod removed) these IP changes are propagated to the App Gateway via the Azure Resource Manager. If we went with the CNI networking model, then the pod would get IP address from the vnet and there would be a mapping in the App Gateway. Alternatively, with the Kubenet model this is how App Gateway will be setup, it will try to assign the same routable created by AKS to App Gateway’s subnet. It’s important to note, whichever model you choose the App Gateway will always connect directly to the pod and this is by design. Deploying AGICAGIC can be deployed in two ways either using Helm or as an AKS add-on. Each has their pros and cons, the key benefit of going via an AKS add-on will be that it will be fully managed and auto updated by Azure (i.e.: all updates, patching etc. for the AGIC will be taken care of automatically) whereas with Helm you will have to do that yourself. Let’s go ahead and deploy a demo AKS cluster with AGIC and see it in action to understand exactly what is going on. For the sake of simplicity, this demo will be creating an AKS cluster with CNI networking model and deploying the AGIC as and AKS add-on. Create an AKS clusterLogin and set the right subscription 12az loginaz account set -s &quot;your-subcription-id&quot; Create a new resource group 1az group create --name agicTestResourceGroup --location eastus Here we are creating a new AKS cluster with CNI networking model (–network-plugin azure) and we are setting up App Gateway as ingress and in this instance we are saying our App Gateway’s name is “testAppGateway” which doesn’t exist and will be created for us Create AKS cluster 1az aks create -n agicTestCluster -g agicTestResourceGroup --network-plugin azure --enable-managed-identity -a ingress-appgw --appgw-name testAppGateway --appgw-subnet-cidr &quot;10.225.0.0/16&quot; --generate-ssh-keys If we go into the Azure Portal, we can see two resource groups (one of them is what we created and this where the Azure managed AKS control plane is), the other resource group (MC_agicTestResourceGroup_agicTestCluster_eastus) is where the node pool, vnet, App Gateway etc all live, this resource group gets created automatically for us as part of the az aks create command. Deploy a sample APINow we have the AKS cluster up and running with AGIC deployed as an add-on, let’s deploy a sample API app and set ingress through the App Gateway. Get credentials to the AKS cluster 1az aks get-credentials -n agicTestCluster -g agicTestResourceGroup Deploy a sample API 1kubectl apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Ricky-G/59eb109913bd45d3e9229f9cf0a97edc/raw/b336047feecd9fd89fbe1a9627ac385b525124fe/sample-api-aks-deployment.yaml The above sample API deployment yaml was taken from the AGIC GitHub repo, the only change made to it was added a minimum of 10 replicas. We are saying we need 10 pods running this API. As soon as you run this you should see the app deployed as a service and 10 pods running successfully and there is a cluster-IPIP set for this (cluster-IP is an IP load balancer that Kubernetes creates, we just need to call this IP and our traffic will be forwarded to one of the 10 pods) Now if we go to the resource group where we have the actual Application Gateway and go to backend pool, we can see there is one here created by AGIC and if we dig into the pool all the IP addresses of the 10 pods are listed here. So, we have direct ingress to the pods from the Application Gateway. Finally, if we run the below command, we should see an ingress IP address for “aspnetapp” which is our sample API. This is the public IP of the Application Gateway, which has been wired up to ingress all the way to the pod. If we paste this IP into the browser, we can see sample aspnet site served from the pod. 1kubectl get ingress Right, so we have successfully ingressed all the way from public ip going via Application Gateway all the way to our pod. Benefits of AGIC Direct connection to the pods without an extra hop, this results in a performance benefit up to 50% lower network latency compared to in-cluster ingress Could make a huge difference in performance and latency sensitive applications and workloads If going the AKS add-on route then it becomes fully managed and updated In cluster ingress consumes and competes for AKS compute/memory resources where was with App Gateway separated from the cluster it won’t be leeching any of the AKS compute Full benefits of the Application Gateway such as WAF, cookie-based affinity, ssl termination amongst many others Limitations Application Gateway has some backend limits. Backend pools are limited to 100. Application Gateway does have a pricing implication Routing is directly to pod IP’s rather than the ClusterIP of the service. There is a feature request open for this Closing ThoughtsKey thing to keep in mind is the backend pool limitation of 100 . If you have more than 100 “ingres-able” services, then you would need multiple Application Gateway’s to cater for this. Although it is a supported scenario and straightforward to set up multiple App Gateways for one AKS cluster, your costs will pile up. At the start of this post, I mentioned a scenario of 2000+ services, in this case we would need 20 App Gateways; 2000 services / 100 = 20. Due to cost implications this won’t be palatable in most cases. On the plus side you get direct connection to the pod and can shave 50% of network latency. So, in this 2000+ services in one cluster scenario we could put the App Gateway as ingress for just latency sensitive apps/API’s and use another traditional in cluster-based ingress for all the other services. This way you get the best of both words while still keeping below the App Gateway max backend pool limits. One neat option for an in cluster-based ingress could be Web Application Routing, which is still in preview at the time of writing this. It’s a managed NGINX based solution that should work well as an in cluster-based ingress controller References AGIC main documentation AGIC GitHub Main image was taken from the Azure site and slightly modified","link":"/AKS/AGIC/application-gateway-ingress-controller-for-aks/"},{"title":"Create A Multi User Experience For Single Threaded Applications Using Azure Container Apps","text":"🎯 TL;DR: Simulating Multi-User Experience for Legacy Single-Threaded Apps Legacy single-threaded applications (one request per process) require multi-user support without costly re-architecture.

Solution: Azure Container Apps with HTTP-based scaling rules that spawn new container instances per concurrent request. Configuration uses min-replicas=0, max-replicas=30 with HTTP scale triggers, achieving 70-90% request isolation across separate container instances for pseudo-multithreaded behavior without code changes. How to make a single-threaded app multi-threaded? This is the scenario I faced very recently. These were legacy web app(s) written to be single-threaded; in this context single-threaded means can only serve one request at a time. I know this goes against everything that a web app should be, but it what it is. So if we have a single threaded web app (legacy) now all of a sudden we have a requirement to support multiple users at the same time. What are our options: Re-architect the app to be multi threaded Find a way to simulate multi threaded behavior Both are great options, but in this scenario option 1 was out, due to the cost involved in re-writing this app to support multi threading. So that leaves us with option 2; how can we at a cloud infra level easily simulate multi threaded behavior. Turns out if we containerize the app (in this case it was easy enough to do) we orchestrate the app such that for each http request is routed to a new container (ie: every new http request should spin up a new container and request send to it) Options For Running ContainersSo when it comes to running a container in Azure our main options are below Here we need to orchestrate containers, ie: at a minimum for every new http request spin a new one), which means we only have two viable options, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Apps (ACA). Both are valid options, each with their own pros/cons, with AKS its a lot more complex we will need to : Think of networking Think of vm’s/vm scale sets for nodes Choose ingress controller and set up ingress rules Identity Plus many more, here is the baseline reference for AKS So in short, as flexible as AKS is its not as easy as something like ACA which is a fully managed version of AKS that abstracts all the complexities of Kubernetes. So for this scenario to prove we can simulate multi threaded experience lets go ahead with ACA. Sample Single Threaded ProgramFor this demo below is a simple C# DotNet app that simulates a single threaded behavior, essentially its doing a lock on a static variable which blocks the whole process for 6 seconds. So when we visit the /test endpoint we lock the whole app. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748public class Program{ private static readonly object LockObject = new(); public static void Main(string[] args) { var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); // Add services to the container. builder.Services.AddAuthorization(); builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer(); builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(); builder.Services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(); var app = builder.Build(); // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) { app.UseSwagger(); app.UseSwaggerUI(); } app.UseAuthorization(); app.MapGet(&quot;/test&quot;, (HttpContext httpContext) =&gt; { if (Monitor.TryEnter(LockObject, new TimeSpan(0, 0, 6))) { try { Thread.Sleep(5000); } finally { Monitor.Exit(LockObject); } } return (&quot;Hello From Container: &quot; + System.Environment.MachineName); }); app.Run(); }} Azure Container AppsFor this demo the easiest way to create the Azure Container Apps environment is through Visual Studio, you right click, publish and go through the menus and in the end VS will create a Container Apps Environment and deploy the code as a container to ACA. Once this is all done, we should have a resource group like below Azure Container Apps ScalingNext we go to the container app (the single threaded api we just deployed) and set up a simple http scale rule that will spin up a new container for every 1 http incoming request. In the example below we set min-replicas to 0 and max to 30 this means that when there is no traffic it will scale down to 0 and at peak it will hit 30. TestingNow go to the url of the container app and hit it simultaneously in browser tabs, when I opened it in multiple browser tabs out of 10 tabs about 7 were served by unique containers and based on the test code above I see it being served by different container ids 1234Tab1: Hello From Container: single-threaded-api-app-20220731--ps4yjjp-66f4885b65-w5s6hTab2: Hello From Container: single-threaded-api-app-20220731--ps4yjjp-66f4885b65-gs8qfTab3: Hello From Container: single-threaded-api-app-20220731--ps4yjjp-66f4885b65-x7grletc So its not 100% every single request goes to a brand new container, but very easily and very quickly with out too much complexity we were able to achieve a 70 - 90% of requests being served with new containers, so in essence we found a quick way to simulate a pseudo - multi threaded experience for our legacy single threaded app with out too much effort.","link":"/Azure/Container-Apps/create-a-multi-user-experience-for-single-threaded-applications-using-azure-container-apps/"},{"title":"Azure Logic Apps Timeout","text":"🎯 TL;DR: Timeout Control Strategies for Azure Logic Apps Logic Apps default timeout behavior doesn’t match production requirements with HTTP triggers timing out at 3.9 minutes and workflow duration defaulting to 90 days. Problem: No granular timeout control per workflow causing long-running processes in production. Solutions: Global Runtime.Backend.FlowRunTimeout setting (minimum 7 days, affects all workflows) or per-workflow timeout branches using parallel “Delay” action with terminate condition for precise timeout control without impacting other workflows. Recently I got pulled into a production incident where a logic app was running for a long time (long time in this scenario was &gt; 10 minutes), but the intention from the dev crew was they wanted this to time out in 60 seconds. These logic apps were a combination of HTTP triggers and Timer based. Logic App Default Time LimitsFirst things to keep in mind are some default limits. If its a HTTP based trigger the default timeout is around 3.9 minutes For most others the default max run duration of a logic app is 90 days and min is 7 days Ways To Change DefaultsWith that, here are a couple of quick ways to make sure your Logic App times out and terminates within the time frame you set. Lets say if we want our Logic App to run no more than 60 seconds at max then: You can change the setting Runtime.Backend.FlowRunTimeout from the default 90 days to 7 days (keep in mind the minimum for this setting is 7 days which is quite large, refer to this issue : https://github.com/Azure/logicapps/issues/782#issuecomment-1609008805) PRO: This will make sure that the Logic App runs for a maximum of 7 days only (which is quite large) CON: However this will apply to all the Logic Apps in the host/tenant, meaning if you had 15 logic apps then all 15 will have the 7 day limit Have a branch with in the Logic App itself to control the timeout (shown in the below diagram) PRO: You have full control of timeout per Logic App, so some can have 30 second time outs while others 60 seconds etc CON: There will be an extra branch/logic in your logic app Time-Out Branch In Logic AppBelow is how a potential timeout out setting in a Logic App could look like. You create a “Delay” branch and set the desired time limit, in the example below its 2 minutes so if the other flow takes longer than two minutes then the delay will finish, logic app will be terminated and a cancelled status will be returned to the user in the below example.

Problem: Missing guidance on linking policies to DevTest Labs using Infrastructure as Code. Solution: Use Microsoft.DevTestLab/labs/policysets resource with ‘default’ name as parent for policy definitions. Implementation includes VM size restrictions, user VM quotas, and premium SSD limits using evaluator types like AllowedValuesPolicy and MaxValuePolicy with proper threshold configurations. Azure DevTest Labs offers a powerful cloud-based development workstation environment and great alternative to a local development workstation/laptop when it comes to software development. This blog post is not so much talking about the benefits of DevTest Lab, but more about how to create policies for DevTest Labs using Bicep. Although there is a good support for deploying DevTest labs with Bicep, there is little to no documentation when it comes to creating policies for DevTest Labs in Bicep. In this blog post, we will focus on creating policies for DevTest Labs using Bicep and how to go about doing this. A Brief Overview of Azure DevTest LabsAzure DevTest Labs is a managed service that enables developers to quickly create, manage, and share development and test environments. It provides a range of features and tools designed to streamline the development process, minimize costs, and improve overall productivity. By leveraging the power of the cloud, developers can easily spin up virtual machines (VMs) pre-configured with the necessary tools, frameworks, and software needed for their projects. Existing Documentation LimitationsWhile the existing documentation covers various aspects of Azure DevTest Labs, it lacks clear guidance on setting up policies with DevTest Labs in Bicep. This blog post aims to address that gap by providing a Bicep script for creating a DevTest Lab and applying policies to it. Shout out to my colleague Illian Y for persisting and not giving up and finding a away around undocumented features and showing me. Existing Documentation For Creating a DevTest LabThe existing documentation for creating a DevTest Lab is pretty good, but when it comes to creating policies for DevTest Lab this is where the documentation falls short.

Problem: Large compressed files cannot be loaded entirely into memory for extraction. Solution: Stream-based unzipping using blob triggers with two implementation options: native .NET ZipArchive (slower but dependency-free) vs SharpZipLib (faster with custom buffer sizes). Architecture includes separate blob containers for zipped/unzipped files with Function App triggered by blob storage events for scalable data processing. Consider this situation: you have a zip file stored in an Azure Blob Storage container (or any other location for that matter). This isn’t just any zip file; it’s large, containing gigabytes of data. It could be big data sets for your machine learning projects, log files, media files, or backups. The specific content isn’t the focus - the size is. The task? We need to unzip this massive file(s) and relocate its contents to a different Azure Blob storage container. This task might seem daunting, especially considering the size of the file and the potential number of files that might be housed within it. Why do we need to do this? The use cases are numerous. Handling large data sets, moving data for analysis, making backups more accessible - these are just a few examples. The key here is that we’re looking for a scalable and reliable solution to handle this task efficiently. Azure Data Factory is arguably a better fit for this sort of task, but In this blog post, we will specifically demonstrate how to establish this process using Azure Functions. Specifically we will try to achieve this within the constraints of the Consumption plan tier, where the maximum memory is capped at 1.5GB, with the supporting roles of Azure CLI and PowerShell in our setup. Setting Up Our Azure EnvironmentBefore we dive into scripting and code, we need to set the stage - that means setting up our Azure environment. We’re going to create a storage account with two containers, one for our Zipped files and the other for Unzipped files. To create this setup, we’ll be using the Azure CLI. Why? Because it’s efficient and lets us script out the whole process if we need to do it again in the future. Install Azure CLI: If you haven’t already installed Azure CLI on your local machine, you can get it from here. Login to Azure: Open your terminal and type the following command to login to your Azure account. You’ll be prompted to enter your credentials. 1az login Create a Resource Group: We’ll need a Resource Group to keep our resources organized. We’ll call this rg-function-app-unzip-test and create it in the eastus location (you can ofcourse choose which ever region you like). 1az group create --name rg-function-app-unzip-test --location eastus Create a Storage Account: Next, we’ll create a storage account within our Resource Group. We’ll name it unziptststorageacct. 1az storage account create --name unziptststorageacct --resource-group rg-function-app-unzip-test --location eastus --sku Standard_LRS Create the Blob Containers: Finally, we’ll create our two containers, ‘Zipped’ and ‘Unzipped’ in the unziptststorageacct storage account. 12az storage container create --name zipped --account-name unziptststorageacctaz storage container create --name unzipped --account-name unziptststorageacct Now your Azure environment is ready with the specific resource group and storage account names you provided! We’ve got our storage account unziptststorageacct and two containers ‘Zipped’ and ‘Unzipped’ set up for our operations. The next step is to create our zip file. Concocting Our Data With PowerShellOur next task is to create a large zip file filled with multiple 100MB files, all brimming with random text. In a real world scenario you would already have these large files, but since we are simulating lets use PowerShell to create them. If you already have an existing zip file with large’ish files for testing, you can skip this step and use that file instead. 123456789101112131415161718192021# Set the number of files we want to create$fileCount = 10# The path where you want to create the TestFiles directory$directory = &quot;C:\\_Temp\\TestFiles&quot;# Create a new directory for our files if it doesn't already existif(-not (Test-Path -Path $directory)){ New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $directory}# Loop through and create our filesfor ($i=1; $i -le $fileCount; $i++){ # Generate a 100MB file filled with random text and save it in our new directory $fileContent = New-Object byte[] 104857600 (New-Object Random).NextBytes($fileContent) [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes(&quot;$directory\\File$i.txt&quot;, $fileContent)}# Now that we have all our files, let's zip them upCompress-Archive -Path &quot;$directory\\*&quot; -DestinationPath &quot;$directory.zip&quot; This is a simple script that is creating 10 files, each 100MB in size, and then zipping them up into a single file. The resulting zip file should be around the 1GB in size. Incase you are wondering how we end up with a 1GB+ file by compressing 1GB worth of data? we are generating files filled with random bytes. Compression algorithms work by finding and eliminating redundancy in the data. Since random data has no redundancy, it cannot be compressed. In fact, trying to compress random data can even result in output that is slightly larger than the input, due to the overhead of the compression format. We’ll use this file to test our Azure Function. Azure Function To UnzipWe’re going to create a Function that magically springs into action the moment a blob (our zipped file) lands in the ‘Zipped’ container. This function will stream the data, unzip the files, and stores them neatly as individual files in the ‘Unzipped’ container. Before we begin, ensure that you’ve installed the Azure Functions Core Tools locally. You’d also need the Azure Functions Extension for Visual Studio Code. First lets use the CLI to create our consumption plan function app. We’ll call it unzipfunctionapp and use the unziptststorageacct storage account we created earlier. We’ll also specify the runtime as dotnet and the functions version as 4. We are using the consumption plan to demonstrate that this solution can work within the constraints of the consumption plan, where the maximum memory is capped at 1.5GB. 1az functionapp create --resource-group rg-function-app-unzip-test --consumption-plan-location eastus --runtime dotnet --functions-version 4 --name unzipfunctionapp123 --storage-account unziptststorageacct You might need to change the function name in the example about from ‘unzipfunctionapp123’. This could already be taken; this is because, Azure function app name must have Globally unique name.When you create Azure function app, you specify the name which becomes part of URL .azurewebsites.net If the function app name is already taken you will get an error ‘Website with given name unzipfunctionapp already exists.’ when you run the cli command above. Now that we have a consumption plan function infra, lets see the full code that will do the actual task of unzipping and uploadingThere are two code samples and both are quite similar in their basic approach. They both handle the data in a streaming manner, which allows them to deal with large files without consuming a lot of memory. However, there are some differences in the details of how they handle the streaming, which may have implications for their performance and resource usage: The first code sample uses the ZipArchive class from the .NET Framework, which provides a high-level, user-friendly interface for dealing with zip files. The second code sample uses the ZipInputStream class from the SharpZipLib library, which provides a lower-level, more flexible interface. In the first code sample, the ZipArchive automatically takes care of reading from the blob stream and unzipping the data. It provides an Open method for each entry in the zip file, which returns a stream that you can read the unzipped data from. In the second code sample, you manually read from the ZipInputStream and write to the blob stream using the StreamUtils.Copy method. The second code sample manually handles the buffer size with new byte[4096] for copying data from the zip input stream to the blob output stream. In contrast, the first code sample relies on the default buffer size provided by the UploadFromStreamAsync method. Memory wise both are similar (i.e.: they don’t download the entire zip file into memory), but the first script takes around 20 minutes to process a 1GB zip file (with 10 * 100 MB files), whereas the second script takes about 10 minutes for the same 1GB zip file. This mainly comes down to setting the custom buffer size and the optimizations in the SharpZipLib library First script has the benefit of not importing any custom library, but cant not run on an Azure consumption plan, at the time of this writing, consumption plan has a max 10 minute runtime. Second script can potentially run on a consumption plan, but comes at a cost of having to import a 3rd party library.

Problem: External dependencies increase complexity and security surface area. Solution: .NET 7 introduces native System.Formats.Tar namespace alongside existing System.IO.Compression for GZip, enabling complete .tar.gz extraction without external dependencies. Implementation uses GZipStream for decompression and TarReader for archive extraction with proper entry type filtering and async operations. IntroductionImagine being in a scenario where a file of type .tar.gz lands in your Azure Blob Storage container. This file, when uncompressed, yields a collection of individual files. The trigger event for the arrival of this file is an Azure function, which springs into action, decompressing the contents and transferring them into a different container. In this context, a team may instinctively reach out for a robust library like SharpZipLib. However, what if there is a mandate to accomplish this without external dependencies? This becomes a reality with .NET 7. In .NET 7, native support for Tar files has been introduced, and GZip is catered to via System.IO.Compression. This means we can decompress a .tar.gz file natively in .NET 7, bypassing any need for external libraries. This post will walk you through this process, providing a practical example using .NET 7 to show how this can be achieved. .NET 7: Native TAR SupportAs of .NET 7, the System.Formats.Tar namespace was introduced to deal with TAR files, adding to the toolkit of .NET developers: System.Formats.Tar.TarFile to pack a directory into a TAR file or extract a TAR file to a directory System.Formats.Tar.TarReader to read a TAR file System.Formats.Tar.TarWriter to write a TAR file These new capabilities significantly simplify the process of working with TAR files in .NET. Lets dive in an have a look at a code sample that demonstrates how to extract a .tar.gz file natively in .NET 7. A Simple Example In .NET 7Below is an example demonstrating the extraction of a .tar.gz file natively in .NET 7 in a simple console app to extract the contents of a .tar.gz file to a directory 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253using System;using System.IO;using System.IO.Compression;using System.Formats.Tar;class Program{ static void Main(string[] args) { string sourceTarGzFilePath = @&quot;C:\\_Temp\\test.tar.gz&quot;; string targetDirectory = @&quot;C:\\_Temp\\ExtractedFiles\\&quot;; string tarFilePath = Path.ChangeExtension(sourceTarGzFilePath, &quot;.tar&quot;); Directory.CreateDirectory(targetDirectory); // Decompress the .gz file using (FileStream originalFileStream = File.OpenRead(sourceTarGzFilePath)) { using (FileStream decompressedFileStream = File.Create(tarFilePath)) { using (GZipStream decompressionStream = new GZipStream(originalFileStream, CompressionMode.Decompress)) { decompressionStream.CopyTo(decompressedFileStream); } } } // Extract the .tar file using (FileStream tarStream = File.OpenRead(tarFilePath)) { using (TarReader tarReader = new TarReader(tarStream)) { TarEntry entry; while ((entry = tarReader.GetNextEntryAsync().Result) != null) { if (entry.EntryType is TarEntryType.SymbolicLink or TarEntryType.HardLink or TarEntryType.GlobalExtendedAttributes) { continue; } Console.WriteLine($&quot;Extracting {entry.Name}&quot;); entry.ExtractToFileAsync(Path.Combine(targetDirectory, entry.Name), true).Wait(); } } } // Delete the temporary .tar file File.Delete(tarFilePath); Console.WriteLine(&quot;Extraction Completed&quot;); }} You can also find this on GitHub Gist. Wrapping UpThe introduction of System.Formats.Tar in .NET 7 marks a significant milestone for developers dealing with .tar.gz files. It provides us with the ability to decompress these file types natively, without relying on external libraries. This functionality is a game-changer as it reduces complexity, minimizes external dependencies, and enhances the versatility of .NET applications. The new namespace System.Formats.Tar, along with the established System.IO.Compression, effectively handle TAR and GZip files. This considerably simplifies the process, making the .NET environment more self-contained and versatile.

I am Ricky Gummadi and I am based out of Auckland, New Zealand. This blog is a space for me to document and share my thoughts &amp; ideas. As Scott Hanselman said “if you get asked a good question, you should post it to share rather than reply by email” and this is the medium for me to do just that. During the day I work for Microsoft as a cloud solution architect, in the evenings I work on my own projects and private consulting. Please note that all opinions, insights, and content shared on this blog are my personal views and do not represent the official position or policies of Microsoft or any other organization I may be
