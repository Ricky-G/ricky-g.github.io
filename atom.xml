This post demonstrates how to keep your data in your compliant region (e.g., New Zealand North) while leveraging Microsoft Foundry in another region (e.g., Australia East) purely for AI inferencing. Using cross-region Private Endpoints over Azure’s backbone network, applications securely access Foundry’s AI capabilities without data traversing the public internet—maintaining both regional compliance and zero-trust security posture.</p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> All data at rest, applications, and Private Endpoints remain in NZN. Microsoft Foundry deployed in AUE provides AI inferencing only. Private connectivity ensures secure, compliant architecture across regions.</p></blockquote><hr><p>When deploying Microsoft Foundry (formerly Azure AI Foundry) in enterprise environments, you’ll face a critical constraint: <strong>Microsoft Foundry isn’t available in every Azure region, yet data residency requirements mandate that all data at rest remains within specific regions.</strong> </p><p>Imagine this scenario: Your organization must keep all data in New Zealand North due to regulatory compliance, but Microsoft Foundry is only available in Australia East. You can’t move data to AUE, but you need Foundry’s AI capabilities. How do you maintain compliance while accessing AI inferencing services?</p><p>The solution is architectural: <strong>Keep all data at rest in your compliant region (NZN) and use Microsoft Foundry in the available region (AUE) purely for AI inferencing.</strong> By deploying cross-region Private Endpoints, applications in NZN securely access Foundry’s AI services over Azure’s backbone network—no public internet, no data residency violations, no compromises.</p><p>This guide walks through the complete architecture, DNS configuration, security considerations, and implementation steps for deploying this cross-region private endpoint pattern.</p><blockquote><p><strong>⚠️ Important: Foundry Agents Service Limitation</strong></p><p><strong>If you plan to use the Foundry Agents service specifically</strong>, there is a known limitation at the time of writing: all Foundry workspace resources (Cosmos DB, Storage Account, AI Search, Foundry Account, Project, Managed Identity, Azure OpenAI, or other Foundry resources used for model deployments) <strong>must be deployed in the same region as the VNet</strong>.</p><p>This means the cross-region pattern described in this post <strong>will not work for Foundry Agents deployments</strong>—you would need to deploy everything in the same region (e.g., all resources in Australia East where Foundry is available).</p><p><strong>However, if you are NOT using the Foundry Agents service</strong> (i.e., you’re only using Foundry for AI inferencing via API calls—OpenAI models, Speech Services, Vision, etc.), then the cross-region private endpoint pattern works perfectly, and all your data can reside in your chosen compliant region as described in this post.</p><p>For more details, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/virtual-networks?view=foundry#known-limitations">Microsoft Learn - Virtual Networks with Foundry Agents - Known Limitations</a></p></blockquote><pre class="mermaid">flowchart TB    subgraph azure["☁️ Azure Backbone"]        direction TB        subgraph NZN["🌏 NZN - Data Residency Region"]            direction TB            subgraph vnet["VNet:  10.1.0.0/16"]                subgraph appsnet["Subnet: snet-apps • 10.1.1.0/24"]                    client[👤 Client App / VM<br/>10.1.1.10]                    data[(💾 Data at Rest<br/>Storage, SQL, etc.)]                end                subgraph pesnet["Subnet: snet • 10.1.2.0/24"]                    pe[🔒 Private Endpoint<br/>10.1.2.4]                end            end            dns[🔐 Private DNS Zones<br/>Resolves to Private IP]        end                subgraph AUE["🌏 AUE - AI Inferencing"]            foundry[[🤖 Microsoft Foundry<br/>myFoundry. cognitiveservices.azure.com]]        end                pe ==>|"🔐 Private Link<br/>"| foundry    end        internet[/"🌐 Public Internet<br/>❌ Blocked"/]        client --> dns    dns -.->|10.1.2.4| pe    client -->|HTTPS| pe        foundry -.-x internet        style azure fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5    style NZN fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2,stroke-width:3px    style AUE fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:3px    style internet fill:#ffebee,stroke:#c62828,stroke-width:2px    style vnet fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#0288d1,stroke-width: 2px    style dns fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:2px    style pe fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ef6c00,stroke-width:3px    style data fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:2px</pre><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Understanding-Microsoft-Foundry"><a href="#Understanding-Microsoft-Foundry" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Microsoft Foundry"></a>Understanding Microsoft Foundry</h2><p>Microsoft Foundry is a unified platform-as-a-service for enterprise AI that brings together agents, models (including Azure OpenAI, Speech, Vision), and AI development tools under one managed resource. Think of it as a comprehensive AI studio environment where developers can build, evaluate, and deploy generative AI applications without the complexity of stitching together multiple Azure services manually.</p><h3 id="Why-Foundry-Matters-for-Enterprise-AI"><a href="#Why-Foundry-Matters-for-Enterprise-AI" class="headerlink" title="Why Foundry Matters for Enterprise AI"></a>Why Foundry Matters for Enterprise AI</h3><p>Foundry provides several enterprise-grade capabilities out of the box:</p><p><strong>Unified AI Platform:</strong> Instead of managing separate Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services, and ML resources, Foundry consolidates these into a single managed environment with consistent APIs and management experiences.</p><p><strong>Enterprise Security &amp; Compliance:</strong> Built-in support for managed identities, RBAC, audit logging, and network isolation ensures your AI applications meet corporate security requirements.</p><p><strong>Observability &amp; Monitoring:</strong> Integrated tracing, logging, and monitoring capabilities help you understand how your AI applications are performing and troubleshoot issues quickly.</p><p><strong>Development Productivity:</strong> A unified development experience through Azure AI Studio portal and SDKs accelerates AI application development by reducing integration overhead.</p><p>Because Foundry encapsulates many Azure AI services and provides such comprehensive capabilities, it has specific networking requirements when you want to integrate it into a secure, enterprise cloud environment. This is where Private Endpoints become critical.</p><h2 id="Azure-Private-Endpoints-The-Foundation-of-Secure-Connectivity"><a href="#Azure-Private-Endpoints-The-Foundation-of-Secure-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Azure Private Endpoints: The Foundation of Secure Connectivity"></a>Azure Private Endpoints: The Foundation of Secure Connectivity</h2><p>An Azure Private Endpoint is essentially a network interface (NIC) with a private IP address from your Azure Virtual Network that connects privately to a supported Azure service. When you create a private endpoint for a service like Foundry, you’re bringing that service into your VNet’s address space, allowing VNet resources to reach the service via an internal IP address instead of traversing the public internet.</p><h3 id="How-Private-Link-Works-Under-the-Hood"><a href="#How-Private-Link-Works-Under-the-Hood" class="headerlink" title="How Private Link Works Under the Hood"></a>How Private Link Works Under the Hood</h3><p>Azure Private Link is the technology that makes Private Endpoints possible. Here’s what happens when you enable private connectivity:</p><ol><li><strong>Private IP Assignment:</strong> A network interface is created in your VNet subnet with a private IP (e.g., <code>10.1.2.4</code>)</li><li><strong>DNS Resolution:</strong> The service’s FQDN (e.g., <code>myFoundry.cognitiveservices.azure.com</code>) is configured to resolve to the private IP instead of the public endpoint</li><li><strong>Backbone Network Transit:</strong> Traffic between your VNet and the service travels entirely on Microsoft’s backbone network, never touching public internet routes</li><li><strong>Regional Flexibility:</strong> The private endpoint can be in a different region than the target service, enabling cross-region private connectivity</li></ol><h3 id="Key-Benefits-of-Private-Endpoints"><a href="#Key-Benefits-of-Private-Endpoints" class="headerlink" title="Key Benefits of Private Endpoints"></a>Key Benefits of Private Endpoints</h3><p><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Traffic never leaves Azure’s internal network, eliminating internet-based attack vectors and data exfiltration risks.</p><p><strong>Supported Across Azure PaaS:</strong> Many Azure services support private endpoints including Storage accounts, SQL databases, Cosmos DB, Cognitive Services (which Foundry uses), Key Vault, and more.</p><p><strong>Cross-Region Capability:</strong> Critically, Azure allows the private endpoint’s NIC to reside in a different region than the service’s region. The private endpoint must be in the same region as the VNet you place it in, but the target resource can be in any Azure region. This is the key feature that enables our solution.</p><p><strong>DNS Integration:</strong> Azure Private DNS Zones provide seamless name resolution, making private endpoint connectivity transparent to applications.</p><h3 id="DNS-Configuration-Requirements"><a href="#DNS-Configuration-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="DNS Configuration Requirements"></a>DNS Configuration Requirements</h3><p>Using a private endpoint requires configuring DNS so that the service’s FQDN resolves to the private IP instead of the public IP. For Azure Cognitive Services (which Foundry is built on), this typically involves:</p><ol><li>Creating a Private DNS Zone: <code>privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com</code></li><li>Linking the zone to your VNets</li><li>Adding an A record mapping the Foundry hostname to the private endpoint IP</li></ol><p>Without proper DNS configuration, clients will continue resolving the public IP address and bypass the private link entirely, defeating the purpose of the security setup.</p><h2 id="The-Cross-Region-Challenge-When-Foundry-Isn’t-Available-Locally"><a href="#The-Cross-Region-Challenge-When-Foundry-Isn’t-Available-Locally" class="headerlink" title="The Cross-Region Challenge: When Foundry Isn’t Available Locally"></a>The Cross-Region Challenge: When Foundry Isn’t Available Locally</h2><h3 id="Understanding-the-Regional-Availability-Problem"><a href="#Understanding-the-Regional-Availability-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Regional Availability Problem"></a>Understanding the Regional Availability Problem</h3><p>Microsoft Foundry is not yet available in every Azure region. At the time of writing, Foundry has limited regional availability as Microsoft continues rolling out the service globally. This creates a common scenario for many organizations:</p><p><strong>The Scenario:</strong> Let’s imagine an organization with Azure infrastructure primarily deployed in New Zealand North (NZN) – perhaps due to data residency requirements, latency optimization for local users, or established governance policies. However, Microsoft Foundry is only available in Australia East (AUE), with New Zealand North not yet on the supported regions list.</p><p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The organization needs to leverage Foundry’s powerful AI capabilities while maintaining private network connectivity and keeping all traffic within the Azure environment. Simply deploying everything in Australia East isn’t feasible due to data residency requirements etc. So all data at rest needs to be in New Zealand North region.  Microsoft Foundry will be used for AI inferencing only and all data at rest must remain in New Zealand North.</p><h3 id="Why-Standard-Approaches-Don’t-Work"><a href="#Why-Standard-Approaches-Don’t-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Standard Approaches Don’t Work"></a>Why Standard Approaches Don’t Work</h3><p>Let’s consider the typical alternatives and why they fall short:</p><p><strong>Deploy Everything in AUE:</strong> This requires relocating or duplicating existing infrastructure, increasing costs and complexity. Data residency requirements may prohibit this approach entirely.</p><p><strong>Use Public Endpoints:</strong> Exposing Foundry via public endpoints contradicts enterprise zero-trust security policies and increases attack surface unnecessarily.</p><p><strong>Accept Regional Limitations:</strong> Waiting for Foundry to become available in your region delays AI initiatives and competitive advantages.</p><h3 id="The-Solution-Cross-Region-Private-Endpoints"><a href="#The-Solution-Cross-Region-Private-Endpoints" class="headerlink" title="The Solution: Cross-Region Private Endpoints"></a>The Solution: Cross-Region Private Endpoints</h3><p>The solution leverages Azure’s support for cross-region Private Endpoints. By deploying a Private Endpoint in your New Zealand North VNet that connects to the Foundry service in Australia East, you achieve several critical outcomes:</p><ul><li><strong>Private Connectivity:</strong> All traffic between NZN and AUE travels on Azure’s backbone network</li><li><strong>Regional Compliance:</strong> Resources remain in their designated regions with private interconnection</li><li><strong>Transparent Access:</strong> Applications in NZN access Foundry as if it’s a local service via private IP</li><li><strong>Security Posture:</strong> Foundry’s public endpoints can be disabled, enforcing private-only access</li></ul><h2 id="Architecture-Deep-Dive-Cross-Region-Foundry-Deployment"><a href="#Architecture-Deep-Dive-Cross-Region-Foundry-Deployment" class="headerlink" title="Architecture Deep Dive: Cross-Region Foundry Deployment"></a>Architecture Deep Dive: Cross-Region Foundry Deployment</h2><h3 id="High-Level-Architecture-Overview"><a href="#High-Level-Architecture-Overview" class="headerlink" title="High-Level Architecture Overview"></a>High-Level Architecture Overview</h3><p>The architecture deploys Microsoft Foundry in Australia East while enabling secure access from resources in New Zealand North. Here’s how the components fit together:</p><p><strong>Foundry Service (Australia East):</strong> The actual Microsoft Foundry resource deployed in AUE, configured as a Cognitive Services account with AI capabilities enabled.</p><p><strong>Private Endpoint (New Zealand North):</strong> A network interface in your NZN VNet with a private IP address (e.g., <code>10.1.2.4</code>) that acts as the gateway to the AUE Foundry service.</p><p><strong>Private DNS Zone:</strong> A DNS zone (<code>privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com</code>) linked to your VNets that resolves the Foundry FQDN to the private endpoint IP.</p><p><strong>Client Applications (New Zealand North):</strong> VMs, App Services, containers, or other resources in NZN that consume the Foundry APIs.</p><pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram    participant C as 👤 Client<br/>10.1.1.10    participant D as 🔐 Private DNS    participant P as 🔒 Private EP<br/>10.1.2.4    participant B as 🌐 Public Internet    participant F as 🤖 Foundry<br/>(AUE)        rect rgb(227, 242, 253)        Note over C,D:  New Zealand North Region    end    rect rgb(232, 245, 232)        Note over F: Australia East Region    end        C->>D: 1.

All the cross-region complexity is abstracted by Azure’s networking layer.</p><h3 id="Critical-Architectural-Considerations"><a href="#Critical-Architectural-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Critical Architectural Considerations"></a>Critical Architectural Considerations</h3><h4 id="Azure-Backbone-Network-Transit"><a href="#Azure-Backbone-Network-Transit" class="headerlink" title="Azure Backbone Network Transit"></a>Azure Backbone Network Transit</h4><p>The connection between NZN and AUE is entirely internal to Azure. No traffic exits to the public internet, even though the regions are geographically separated across the Tasman Sea. Azure’s global backbone network handles the routing, ensuring:</p><ul><li><strong>Security:</strong> Traffic never traverses public networks</li><li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Azure’s backbone offers higher SLAs than internet routes  </li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> Optimized routing between Azure datacenters</li></ul><h4 id="Private-DNS-Resolution-Requirements"><a href="#Private-DNS-Resolution-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Private DNS Resolution Requirements"></a>Private DNS Resolution Requirements</h4><p>DNS configuration is the linchpin that makes private endpoints work correctly. Microsoft Foundry (AIServices kind) requires multiple Private DNS zones for full functionality:</p><p><strong>Required Private DNS Zones:</strong></p><ol><li><code>privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com</code> - Primary Cognitive Services endpoint</li><li><code>privatelink.openai.azure.com</code> - Azure OpenAI service endpoints</li><li><code>privatelink.services.ai.azure.com</code> - AI Foundry management endpoints</li></ol><p><strong>Configuration Steps:</strong></p><p><strong>DNS Zone Creation:</strong> Create all required Private DNS zones in your subscription</p><p><strong>VNet Linking:</strong> Link the DNS zones to your NZN VNet (and any other VNets that need access)</p><p><strong>A Record Mapping:</strong> Azure automatically creates the necessary A records when using DNS zone groups with private endpoints, or you can manually add A records for your Foundry resource pointing to the private endpoint IP</p><p><strong>Multi-VNet Scenarios:</strong> If you have separate VNets (e.g., hub-and-spoke topology), ensure all VNets are linked to the DNS zones or use DNS forwarding</p><p>Without proper DNS configuration across all zones, clients will resolve public IPs and bypass your private endpoint entirely, rendering the security setup ineffective.</p><h4 id="Performance-and-Latency-Implications"><a href="#Performance-and-Latency-Implications" class="headerlink" title="Performance and Latency Implications"></a>Performance and Latency Implications</h4><p>While traffic stays private, the cross-region architecture introduces additional latency:</p><p><strong>Typical Latency:</strong> NZN to AUE is a trans-Tasman hop, usually adding 30-60ms compared to in-region calls</p><p><strong>Acceptable Use Cases:</strong> Most AI API calls (text generation, embeddings, etc.) can tolerate this latency</p><p><strong>Latency-Sensitive Workloads:</strong> Real-time voice applications or ultra-low-latency requirements may need careful evaluation</p><p><strong>Bandwidth Charges:</strong> Azure charges for cross-region data transfer. Egress from AUE to NZN incurs bandwidth costs. Budget accordingly for high-volume scenarios.</p><h4 id="Security-Posture-Enhancement"><a href="#Security-Posture-Enhancement" class="headerlink" title="Security Posture Enhancement"></a>Security Posture Enhancement</h4><p>Private Endpoints enable several security improvements:</p><p><strong>Disable Public Access:</strong> Configure Foundry to reject all public network connections, forcing traffic through approved private endpoints</p><p><strong>Network Security Groups (NSGs):</strong> Apply NSGs to the private endpoint subnet to control which source IPs can reach the Foundry service</p><p><strong>Azure Firewall Integration:</strong> Route private endpoint traffic through Azure Firewall for additional inspection and logging</p><p><strong>On-Premises Connectivity:</strong> If you have ExpressRoute or VPN connecting on-premises to Azure, those networks can also access Foundry privately through the NZN VNet</p><h2 id="Step-by-Step-Implementation-Overview"><a href="#Step-by-Step-Implementation-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Step-by-Step Implementation Overview"></a>Step-by-Step Implementation Overview</h2><blockquote><p><strong>⚠️ Important: Choose Your Own Unique Name</strong></p><p>The name <code>myFoundryDemo</code> used throughout these examples is <strong>already taken</strong> in Azure’s global namespace. Cognitive Services accounts require globally unique names across all Azure subscriptions worldwide.</p><p><strong>Before running any commands below:</strong> Replace <code>myFoundryDemo</code> with your own unique name (e.g., <code>myFoundryProd2025</code>, <code>contoso-ai-foundry</code>, etc.) in all the Azure CLI commands. This name will become part of your endpoint URL: <code>&lt;your-unique-name&gt;.cognitiveservices.azure.com</code></p></blockquote><p>The following sections walk through the high-level steps to implement this architecture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Deploy Microsoft Foundry Cross-Region with Private Endpoints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Foundry isn’t available in every Azure region, but data residency requirements often mandate that all data at rest stays within specific regions. This post demonstrates how to keep your data in your compliant region (e.g., New Zealand North) while leveraging Microsoft Foundry in another region (e.g., Australia East) purely for AI inferencing. Using cross-region Private Endpoints over Azure’s backbone network, applications securely access Foundry’s AI capabilities without data traversing the public internet—maintaining both regional compliance and zero-trust security posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; All data at rest, applications, and Private Endpoints remain in NZN. Microsoft Foundry deployed in AUE provides AI inferencing only. Private connectivity ensures secure, compliant architecture across regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deploying Microsoft Foundry (formerly Azure AI Foundry) in enterprise environments, you’ll face a critical constraint: &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Foundry isn’t available in every Azure region, yet data residency requirements mandate that all data at rest remains within specific regions.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine this scenario: Your organization must keep all data in New Zealand North due to regulatory compliance, but Microsoft Foundry is only available in Australia East. You can’t move data to AUE, but you need Foundry’s AI capabilities. How do you maintain compliance while accessing AI inferencing services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is architectural: &lt;strong&gt;Keep all data at rest in your compliant region (NZN) and use Microsoft Foundry in the available region (AUE) purely for AI inferencing.&lt;/strong&gt; By deploying cross-region Private Endpoints, applications in NZN securely access Foundry’s AI services over Azure’s backbone network—no public internet, no data residency violations, no compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide walks through the complete architecture, DNS configuration, security considerations, and implementation steps for deploying this cross-region private endpoint pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚠️ Important: Foundry Agents Service Limitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you plan to use the Foundry Agents service specifically&lt;/strong&gt;, there is a known limitation at the time of writing: all Foundry workspace resources (Cosmos DB, Storage Account, AI Search, Foundry Account, Project, Managed Identity, Azure OpenAI, or other Foundry resources used for model deployments) &lt;strong&gt;must be deployed in the same region as the VNet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the cross-region pattern described in this post &lt;strong&gt;will not work for Foundry Agents deployments&lt;/strong&gt;—you would need to deploy everything in the same region (e.g., all resources in Australia East where Foundry is available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, if you are NOT using the Foundry Agents service&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., you’re only using Foundry for AI inferencing via API calls—OpenAI models, Speech Services, Vision, etc.), then the cross-region private endpoint pattern works perfectly, and all your data can reside in your chosen compliant region as described in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/virtual-networks?view=foundry#known-limitations&quot;&gt;Microsoft Learn - Virtual Networks with Foundry Agents - Known Limitations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr><blockquote><p><strong>🎯 TL;DR: Bulk Configure Searchable Branches in Azure DevOps via Hidden Policy API</strong></p><p>Azure DevOps code search only indexes the default branch (master&#x2F;main) by default, causing issues when teams use <code>develop</code> branches for JFrog Artifactory detection scripts. Problem: No documented API exists for bulk updating searchable branches across thousands of repositories. Solution: Use the undocumented Policy Configuration API with policy type <code>0517f88d-4ec5-4343-9d26-9930ebd53069</code> to programmatically add branches to the searchable list. This approach leverages the same API calls the Azure DevOps UI uses internally, enabling automation of what would otherwise require manual configuration across massive repository collections.</p></blockquote><hr><p>Recently, I encountered an interesting challenge while working on a JFrog Artifactory adoption tracking project across a large Azure DevOps organization. The requirement was to scan repositories for JFrog URL references to determine which teams had successfully onboarded to their new artifact management system. The problem? Some development teams exclusively work in <code>develop</code> branches instead of <code>master</code> or <code>main</code>, and Azure DevOps code search only indexes the default branch by default.</p><p>This seemingly simple requirement - adding <code>develop</code> to the searchable branches for thousands of repositories - turned into a fascinating exploration of Azure DevOps’ undocumented APIs. While there’s no official documentation for bulk updating searchable branches, I discovered that the Azure DevOps UI uses a specific Policy Configuration API under the hood that we can leverage for automation.</p><p>This blog post shares a practical approach to programmatically configure searchable branches across large Azure DevOps organizations using REST APIs that Microsoft doesn’t officially document but absolutely supports.</p><h2 id="The-Challenge-Azure-DevOps-Code-Search-Limitations"><a href="#The-Challenge-Azure-DevOps-Code-Search-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="The Challenge: Azure DevOps Code Search Limitations"></a>The Challenge: Azure DevOps Code Search Limitations</h2><p>Azure DevOps code search is a powerful feature, but it comes with a significant limitation that affects many organizations: by default, only the repository’s default branch (typically <code>master</code> or <code>main</code>) is indexed for search operations.</p><p>This creates problems in several scenarios:</p><p><strong>JFrog Adoption Tracking:</strong> Organizations implementing JFrog Artifactory need to scan all repositories for configuration files and dependency references, but teams using feature branches or <code>develop</code> as their primary branch won’t be detected.</p><p><strong>Multi-Branch Development:</strong> Teams practicing GitFlow or similar branching strategies may have critical code in <code>develop</code>, <code>release/*</code>, or feature branches that needs to be searchable.</p><p><strong>Compliance and Security Scanning:</strong> Security tools and compliance scripts that rely on code search may miss important files if they’re not in the default branch.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Understanding-Azure-DevOps-Searchable-Branches"><a href="#Understanding-Azure-DevOps-Searchable-Branches" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Azure DevOps Searchable Branches"></a>Understanding Azure DevOps Searchable Branches</h2><p>In Azure DevOps, searchable branches are configured at the repository level through the UI:</p><p><strong>Manual Configuration Path:</strong></p><ol><li>Navigate to Project Settings → Repositories</li><li>Select your repository</li><li>Go to Settings → Searchable Branches</li><li>Add additional branches (maximum of 5 extra branches)</li></ol><p><strong>What Actually Happens:</strong><br>When you configure searchable branches through the UI, Azure DevOps creates or updates a policy configuration with a specific policy type.

Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><p>Working with Azure DevOps searchable branches requires understanding the underlying Policy Configuration API that Microsoft uses internally but doesn’t officially

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Bulk Configure Searchable Branches in Azure DevOps via Hidden Policy API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure DevOps code search only indexes the default branch (master&amp;#x2F;main) by default, causing issues when teams use &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branches for JFrog Artifactory detection scripts. Problem: No documented API exists for bulk updating searchable branches across thousands of repositories. Solution: Use the undocumented Policy Configuration API with policy type &lt;code&gt;0517f88d-4ec5-4343-9d26-9930ebd53069&lt;/code&gt; to programmatically add branches to the searchable list. This approach leverages the same API calls the Azure DevOps UI uses internally, enabling automation of what would otherwise require manual configuration across massive repository collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I encountered an interesting challenge while working on a JFrog Artifactory adoption tracking project across a large Azure DevOps organization. The requirement was to scan repositories for JFrog URL references to determine which teams had successfully onboarded to their new artifact management system. The problem? Some development teams exclusively work in &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branches instead of &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, and Azure DevOps code search only indexes the default branch by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemingly simple requirement - adding &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; to the searchable branches for thousands of repositories - turned into a fascinating exploration of Azure DevOps’ undocumented APIs. While there’s no official documentation for bulk updating searchable branches, I discovered that the Azure DevOps UI uses a specific Policy Configuration API under the hood that we can leverage for automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post shares a practical approach to programmatically configure searchable branches across large Azure DevOps organizations using REST APIs that Microsoft doesn’t officially document but absolutely supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;The-Challenge-Azure-DevOps-Code-Search-Limitations&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#The-Challenge-Azure-DevOps-Code-Search-Limitations&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;The Challenge: Azure DevOps Code Search Limitations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Challenge: Azure DevOps Code Search Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azure DevOps code search is a powerful feature, but it comes with a significant limitation that affects many organizations: by default, only the repository’s default branch (typically &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;) is indexed for search operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates problems in several scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JFrog Adoption Tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations implementing JFrog Artifactory need to scan all repositories for configuration files and dependency references, but teams using feature branches or &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; as their primary branch won’t be detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Branch Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Teams practicing GitFlow or similar branching strategies may have critical code in &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;release/*&lt;/code&gt;, or feature branches that needs to be searchable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance and Security Scanning:&lt;/strong&gt; Security tools and compliance scripts that rely on code search may miss important files if they’re not in the default branch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr><blockquote><p><strong>🎯 TL;DR: Real-time Voice Agent Implementation</strong></p><p>This post walks through building a voice agent that connects traditional phone calls to Azure’s AI services. The system intercepts incoming calls via Azure Communication Services, streams audio in real-time to the Voice Live API, and processes conversations through pre-configured AI agents in Azure AI Studio. The implementation uses FastAPI for webhook handling, WebSocket connections for bidirectional audio streaming, and Azure Managed Identity for authentication (no API keys to manage). The architecture handles multiple concurrent calls on a single Python thread using asyncio.</p><p><strong>Implementation details:</strong> Audio resampling between 16kHz (ACS requirement) and 24kHz (Voice Live requirement), connection resilience for preview services, and production deployment considerations. <strong><a href="https://github.com/Ricky-G/azure-scenario-hub/tree/main/src/azure-communication-services-integrate-voice-live-api/python">Full source code and documentation available here</a></strong></p></blockquote><hr><p>Recently, I found myself co-leading an innovation project that pushed me into uncharted territory.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Real-time Voice Agent Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post walks through building a voice agent that connects traditional phone calls to Azure’s AI services. The system intercepts incoming calls via Azure Communication Services, streams audio in real-time to the Voice Live API, and processes conversations through pre-configured AI agents in Azure AI Studio. The implementation uses FastAPI for webhook handling, WebSocket connections for bidirectional audio streaming, and Azure Managed Identity for authentication (no API keys to manage). The architecture handles multiple concurrent calls on a single Python thread using asyncio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation details:&lt;/strong&gt; Audio resampling between 16kHz (ACS requirement) and 24kHz (Voice Live requirement), connection resilience for preview services, and production deployment considerations. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ricky-G/azure-scenario-hub/tree/main/src/azure-communication-services-integrate-voice-live-api/python&quot;&gt;Full source code and documentation available here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I found myself co-leading an innovation project that pushed me into uncharted territory. The challenge? Developing a voice-based agentic solution with an ambitious goal - routing at least 25% of current contact center calls to AI voice agents. This was bleeding-edge stuff, with both the Azure Voice Live API and Azure AI Agent Service voice agents still in preview at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re working with preview services, documentation is often sparse, and you quickly learn that reverse engineering network calls and maintaining close relationships with product teams becomes part of your daily routine. This blog post shares the practical lessons learned and the working solution we built to integrate these cutting-edge services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;The-Innovation-Challenge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#The-Innovation-Challenge&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;The Innovation Challenge&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Innovation Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a voice agent system that could handle real customer interactions meant tackling several complex requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time voice processing with minimal latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural conversation flow without awkward pauses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with existing contact center infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability to handle multiple concurrent calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability for production use cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live&quot;&gt;Azure Voice Live API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview&quot;&gt;Azure AI Voice Agent Service&lt;/a&gt; in preview, we were essentially building on shifting sands. But that’s what innovation is about - pushing boundaries and finding solutions where documentation doesn’t yet exist.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike Git repositories, TFVC follows a one-repository-per-project model with hierarchical folder structures starting at <code>$/ProjectName</code>. The solution uses the TFVC Items API with specific parameters: <code>scopePath=$/ProjectName</code> to target the project root, and <code>recursionLevel=OneLevel</code> to retrieve immediate children.

This was a nice little problem to solve because, let’s be honest, we don’t really deal with these legacy TFVC repositories much anymore. Most teams have migrated to Git, and the documentation around TFVC API interactions has become somewhat sparse over the years.</p><p>The challenge was straightforward but frustrating: they could retrieve project information just fine, but getting the actual TFVC folder structure within each project? That’s where things got tricky. After doing a bit of digging through the API documentation and testing different approaches, I’m happy to say that yes, it is absolutely possible to enumerate all TFVC repositories and their folder structures programmatically.</p><p>This blog post shares the solution I put together - a practical approach to retrieve TFVC repository structure using the Azure DevOps Server REST APIs. If you’re working with legacy TFVC repositories and need to interact with them programmatically, this one’s for you.</p><h2 id="The-Challenge-Understanding-TFVC-API-Limitations"><a href="#The-Challenge-Understanding-TFVC-API-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="The Challenge: Understanding TFVC API Limitations"></a>The Challenge: Understanding TFVC API Limitations</h2><p>Unlike Git repositories where each project can contain multiple repos, TFVC follows a different model where each project contains exactly one TFVC repository. This fundamental difference affects how you interact with the API and retrieve repository information.</p><p>The main challenge developers face is distinguishing between project metadata and actual TFVC repository structure. When calling the standard Projects API, you receive project information but not the folder structure within the TFVC repository itself.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Common-Misconceptions-About-TFVC-APIs"><a href="#Common-Misconceptions-About-TFVC-APIs" class="headerlink" title="Common Misconceptions About TFVC APIs"></a>Common Misconceptions About TFVC APIs</h2><p>Many developers make the mistake of thinking that the Projects API or the Items API with default parameters will return the TFVC folder structure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Retrieving TFVC Repository Structure via REST API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post demonstrates how to programmatically enumerate TFVC repository folders using Azure DevOps Server REST APIs. Unlike Git repositories, TFVC follows a one-repository-per-project model with hierarchical folder structures starting at &lt;code&gt;$/ProjectName&lt;/code&gt;. The solution uses the TFVC Items API with specific parameters: &lt;code&gt;scopePath=$/ProjectName&lt;/code&gt; to target the project root, and &lt;code&gt;recursionLevel=OneLevel&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve immediate children. The implementation handles authentication via Personal Access Tokens, filters results to show only folders (excluding the root), and includes error handling for projects without TFVC repositories or insufficient permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key technical details:&lt;/strong&gt; PowerShell script implementation, proper API parameter usage, authentication setup, and handling edge cases like empty repositories and access permissions. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ricky-G/script-library/blob/main/TFS-TFVC-Scripts-README.md&quot;&gt;Complete PowerShell script and utilities available here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was asked an interesting question by a developer who was struggling with Azure DevOps Server APIs around fetching repository metadata for legacy TFVC structures as part of a GitHub migration from ADO Server. This was a nice little problem to solve because, let’s be honest, we don’t really deal with these legacy TFVC repositories much anymore. Most teams have migrated to Git, and the documentation around TFVC API interactions has become somewhat sparse over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge was straightforward but frustrating: they could retrieve project information just fine, but getting the actual TFVC folder structure within each project? That’s where things got tricky. After doing a bit of digging through the API documentation and testing different approaches, I’m happy to say that yes, it is absolutely possible to enumerate all TFVC repositories and their folder structures programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post shares the solution I put together - a practical approach to retrieve TFVC repository structure using the Azure DevOps Server REST APIs. If you’re working with legacy TFVC repositories and need to interact with them programmatically, this one’s for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;The-Challenge-Understanding-TFVC-API-Limitations&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#The-Challenge-Understanding-TFVC-API-Limitations&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;The Challenge: Understanding TFVC API Limitations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Challenge: Understanding TFVC API Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Git repositories where each project can contain multiple repos, TFVC follows a different model where each project contains exactly one TFVC repository. This fundamental difference affects how you interact with the API and retrieve repository information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge developers face is distinguishing between project metadata and actual TFVC repository structure. When calling the standard Projects API, you receive project information but not the folder structure within the TFVC repository itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr><blockquote><p><strong>🎯 TL;DR: Distributed Development with Azure VMs and Dev Containers</strong></p><p>This post details solving a distributed development challenge where 8 developers from different organizations needed to collaborate on an AutoGen AI project - 4 from restricted corporate environments unable to install development tools, and 4 external developers without access to client systems. The solution uses a shared Azure VM (Standard D8s v3) with individual user accounts, certificate-based SSH authentication, and VS Code Remote Development connected to a shared Dev Container environment. The architecture eliminates “works on my machine” issues by providing consistent development environments, shared resources (datasets, models, configs), and enables real-time collaboration.</p><p><strong>Implementation highlights:</strong> Automated user provisioning scripts, VS Code Remote-SSH configuration, comprehensive devcontainer.json with pre-installed Python 3.12&#x2F;AutoGen&#x2F;Azure CLI, shared directory structures, and security hardening with fail2ban and UFW. <strong><a href="https://github.com/Ricky-G/script-library">Development environment setup scripts and configurations documented here</a></strong></p></blockquote><hr><h2 id="Introduction-When-Traditional-Solutions-Hit-a-Wall"><a href="#Introduction-When-Traditional-Solutions-Hit-a-Wall" class="headerlink" title="Introduction: When Traditional Solutions Hit a Wall"></a>Introduction: When Traditional Solutions Hit a Wall</h2><p>Last month, I found myself facing a challenge that I’m sure many of you have encountered: How do you enable seamless collaboration for a development team when half of them work in a locked-down environment where they can’t install any development tools, and the other half can’t access the client’s systems?</p><p>Our team of eight developers was tasked with building a proof-of-concept (PoC) for an AI-powered agentic system using Microsoft’s AutoGen framework. Here’s the kicker: this was a 3-week PoC sprint bringing together two teams from different organizations who had never worked together before. We needed a collaborative environment that could be spun up quickly, require minimal setup effort, and allow everyone to hit the ground running from day one.</p><p>The project requirements were complex enough, but the real challenge? Four developers worked from a highly restricted corporate environment where installing Python, VS Code, or any development tools was strictly prohibited. The remaining four worked from our offices but couldn’t access the client’s internal systems directly.</p><p>We tried the usual approaches:</p><ul><li><strong>RDP connections</strong>: Blocked by security policies</li><li><strong>VPN access</strong>: Denied due to compliance requirements</li><li><strong>Local development with file sharing</strong>: Immediate sync issues and “works on my machine” problems</li><li><strong>Cloud IDEs</strong>: Didn’t meet the client’s security requirements</li></ul><p>Just when we thought we’d have to resort to the dreaded “develop locally and pray it works in production” approach, we discovered a solution that not only solved our immediate problem but revolutionized how we approach distributed development.</p><h2 id="The-Architecture-That-Worked-For-Us"><a href="#The-Architecture-That-Worked-For-Us" class="headerlink" title="The Architecture That Worked For Us"></a>The Architecture That Worked For Us</h2><p>Here’s a visual representation of what we built, everyone had to work on their personal (non-corporate) laptops for this to work.</p><pre class="mermaid">flowchart TD    A["� 8 Developers on Personal Laptops<br/>4 Restricted + 4 External Teams"]        B["� SSH + VS Code Remote Connection<br/>Certificate-based Authentication"]        C["☁️ Azure VM (Standard D8s v3)<br/>8 vCPUs • 32GB RAM • Ubuntu 22.04"]        D["👤 Individual User Accounts<br/>user1, user2, user3... user8"]        E["🐳 Shared Dev Container<br/>Python 3.12 + AutoGen + Azure CLI<br/>All Dependencies Pre-installed"]        F["📂 Shared Development Resources<br/>• Project Repository<br/>• Datasets & Models<br/>• Configuration Files"]        G["✅ Results Achieved<br/>94% Faster Onboarding<br/>$400/month vs $16k laptops<br/>Enhanced Security"]        A --> B    B --> C    C --> D    D --> E    E --> F    F --> G        style A fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2,stroke-width:3px,color:#000    style B fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:3px,color:#000    style C fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#0277bd,stroke-width:3px,color:#000    style D fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-width:3px,color:#000    style E fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:3px,color:#000    style F fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-width:3px,color:#000    style G fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:3px,color:#000</pre><p>Lets check out how this was built and setup…</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="The-Deep-Dive-How-We-Built-It"><a href="#The-Deep-Dive-How-We-Built-It" class="headerlink" title="The Deep Dive: How We Built It"></a>The Deep Dive: How We Built It</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Provisioning-the-Azure-VM"><a href="#Step-1-Provisioning-the-Azure-VM" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Provisioning the Azure VM"></a>Step 1: Provisioning the Azure VM</h3><p>We started with a Linux VM in Azure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Distributed Development with Azure VMs and Dev Containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post details solving a distributed development challenge where 8 developers from different organizations needed to collaborate on an AutoGen AI project - 4 from restricted corporate environments unable to install development tools, and 4 external developers without access to client systems. The solution uses a shared Azure VM (Standard D8s v3) with individual user accounts, certificate-based SSH authentication, and VS Code Remote Development connected to a shared Dev Container environment. The architecture eliminates “works on my machine” issues by providing consistent development environments, shared resources (datasets, models, configs), and enables real-time collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation highlights:&lt;/strong&gt; Automated user provisioning scripts, VS Code Remote-SSH configuration, comprehensive devcontainer.json with pre-installed Python 3.12&amp;#x2F;AutoGen&amp;#x2F;Azure CLI, shared directory structures, and security hardening with fail2ban and UFW. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ricky-G/script-library&quot;&gt;Development environment setup scripts and configurations documented here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Introduction-When-Traditional-Solutions-Hit-a-Wall&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Introduction-When-Traditional-Solutions-Hit-a-Wall&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Introduction: When Traditional Solutions Hit a Wall&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction: When Traditional Solutions Hit a Wall&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, I found myself facing a challenge that I’m sure many of you have encountered: How do you enable seamless collaboration for a development team when half of them work in a locked-down environment where they can’t install any development tools, and the other half can’t access the client’s systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team of eight developers was tasked with building a proof-of-concept (PoC) for an AI-powered agentic system using Microsoft’s AutoGen framework. Here’s the kicker: this was a 3-week PoC sprint bringing together two teams from different organizations who had never worked together before. We needed a collaborative environment that could be spun up quickly, require minimal setup effort, and allow everyone to hit the ground running from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project requirements were complex enough, but the real challenge? Four developers worked from a highly restricted corporate environment where installing Python, VS Code, or any development tools was strictly prohibited. The remaining four worked from our offices but couldn’t access the client’s internal systems directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried the usual approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RDP connections&lt;/strong&gt;: Blocked by security policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPN access&lt;/strong&gt;: Denied due to compliance requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local development with file sharing&lt;/strong&gt;: Immediate sync issues and “works on my machine” problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud IDEs&lt;/strong&gt;: Didn’t meet the client’s security requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when we thought we’d have to resort to the dreaded “develop locally and pray it works in production” approach, we discovered a solution that not only solved our immediate problem but revolutionized how we approach distributed development.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr><blockquote><p><strong>🎯 TL;DR: Hybrid GPT-4o Realtime with Azure Speech Services Custom Voices</strong></p><p>This post demonstrates bypassing GPT-4o Realtime’s built-in voice limitations by creating a hybrid architecture that combines GPT-4o’s conversational intelligence with Azure Speech Services’ extensive voice catalog. The solution configures GPT-4o Realtime for text-only output (<code>ContentModalities.Text</code>) and routes responses through Azure Speech Services, enabling access to 400+ neural voices, custom neural voices (CNV), and SSML control. The implementation includes intelligent barge-in functionality using real-time audio amplitude monitoring, allowing users to interrupt the assistant naturally mid-response.</p><p><strong>Technical implementation:</strong> C# application using Azure.AI.OpenAI and Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech SDKs, NAudio for audio I&#x2F;O, streaming text collection from GPT-4o responses, RMS-based speech detection with configurable thresholds, and concurrent audio management for seamless interruption handling. <strong><a href="https://github.com/Ricky-G/azure-scenario-hub/tree/main/custom-voice-sample-code">Complete C# source code with audio helpers available here</a></strong></p></blockquote><hr><p>Building realtime voice-enabled applications with Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4o Realtime model is incredibly powerful, but there’s one significant limitation that can be a deal-breaker for many use cases: you’re stuck with OpenAI’s predefined voices like “sage”, “alloy”, “echo”, “fable”, “onyx”, and “nova”. </p><p>What if you’re building a branded customer service bot that needs to match your company’s voice identity? Or developing a therapeutic application for children with autism where the voice quality and tone are crucial for engagement? What if your users need to interrupt the assistant naturally, just like in real human conversations?</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, I’ll show you exactly how I solved these challenges by building a hybrid solution that combines the conversational intelligence of GPT-4o Realtime with the voice flexibility of Azure Speech Services. We’ll dive deep into the implementation, covering everything from the initial problem to the complete working solution.</p><pre class="mermaid">flowchart TD    A[👤 User speaks] --> B[🎤 Microphone Input]    B --> C{Barge-in Detection<br/>Audio Level > Threshold?}    C -->|Yes| D[🛑 Stop Azure Speech]    C -->|No| E[📡 Stream to GPT-4o Realtime]        E --> F[🧠 GPT-4o Processing]    F --> G[📝 Text Response<br/>ContentModalities.Text]        G --> H[🗣️ Azure Speech Services<br/>Custom/Neural Voice]    H --> I[🔊 Audio Output]        D --> E    I --> J[👂 User hears response]    J --> A        style A fill:#e1f5fe    style D fill:#ffebee    style G fill:#f3e5f5    style H fill:#e8f5e8    style I fill:#fff3e0</pre><span id="more"></span><h2 id="The-real-problem-Why-GPT-4o-Realtime’s-voice-limitations-matter"><a href="#The-real-problem-Why-GPT-4o-Realtime’s-voice-limitations-matter" class="headerlink" title="The real problem: Why GPT-4o Realtime’s voice limitations matter"></a>The real problem: Why GPT-4o Realtime’s voice limitations matter</h2><p>When you’re working with Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4o Realtime API, the standard approach involves configuring a <code>RealtimeConversationSession</code> with one of the predefined voices. While these voices are high-quality, they create several significant limitations:</p><h3 id="1-Limited-voice-selection"><a href="#1-Limited-voice-selection" class="headerlink" title="1. Limited voice selection"></a>1. Limited voice selection</h3><p>You’re restricted to just six built-in voices. There’s no access to Azure Speech Services’ extensive catalog of 400+ neural voices across 140+ languages and locales. You can’t use premium voices like Jenny Neural (en-US) or specialized voices optimized for different use cases.</p><h3 id="2-No-custom-neural-voices"><a href="#2-No-custom-neural-voices" class="headerlink" title="2. No custom neural voices"></a>2. No custom neural voices</h3><p>Perhaps most importantly, you can’t integrate custom neural voices (CNV) that you’ve trained in Azure Speech Studio. This is crucial for:</p><ul><li><strong>Brand consistency</strong>: Companies that have invested in custom voice branding</li><li><strong>Specialized applications</strong>: Healthcare, education, or accessibility apps requiring specific voice characteristics</li><li><strong>Multilingual scenarios</strong>: Custom voices trained on specific accents or dialects</li></ul><h3 id="3-No-natural-interruption-barge-in"><a href="#3-No-natural-interruption-barge-in" class="headerlink" title="3. No natural interruption (barge-in)"></a>3. No natural interruption (barge-in)</h3><p>The built-in system doesn’t provide a way for users to naturally interrupt the assistant mid-response. In real conversations, we constantly interrupt each other—it’s natural and expected. Without this capability, your bot feels robotic and frustrating to use.</p><h3 id="4-Limited-voice-control"><a href="#4-Limited-voice-control" class="headerlink" title="4.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Hybrid GPT-4o Realtime with Azure Speech Services Custom Voices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post demonstrates bypassing GPT-4o Realtime’s built-in voice limitations by creating a hybrid architecture that combines GPT-4o’s conversational intelligence with Azure Speech Services’ extensive voice catalog. The solution configures GPT-4o Realtime for text-only output (&lt;code&gt;ContentModalities.Text&lt;/code&gt;) and routes responses through Azure Speech Services, enabling access to 400+ neural voices, custom neural voices (CNV), and SSML control. The implementation includes intelligent barge-in functionality using real-time audio amplitude monitoring, allowing users to interrupt the assistant naturally mid-response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical implementation:&lt;/strong&gt; C# application using Azure.AI.OpenAI and Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech SDKs, NAudio for audio I&amp;#x2F;O, streaming text collection from GPT-4o responses, RMS-based speech detection with configurable thresholds, and concurrent audio management for seamless interruption handling. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ricky-G/azure-scenario-hub/tree/main/custom-voice-sample-code&quot;&gt;Complete C# source code with audio helpers available here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building realtime voice-enabled applications with Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4o Realtime model is incredibly powerful, but there’s one significant limitation that can be a deal-breaker for many use cases: you’re stuck with OpenAI’s predefined voices like “sage”, “alloy”, “echo”, “fable”, “onyx”, and “nova”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you’re building a branded customer service bot that needs to match your company’s voice identity? Or developing a therapeutic application for children with autism where the voice quality and tone are crucial for engagement? What if your users need to interrupt the assistant naturally, just like in real human conversations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this comprehensive guide, I’ll show you exactly how I solved these challenges by building a hybrid solution that combines the conversational intelligence of GPT-4o Realtime with the voice flexibility of Azure Speech Services. We’ll dive deep into the implementation, covering everything from the initial problem to the complete working solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Stream-Based Large File Processing in Azure Functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing multi-gigabyte zip files in Azure Functions requires streaming approach due to 1.5GB memory limit on Consumption plan. Problem: Large compressed files cannot be loaded entirely into memory for extraction. Solution: Stream-based unzipping using blob triggers with two implementation options: native .NET ZipArchive (slower but dependency-free) vs SharpZipLib (faster with custom buffer sizes). Architecture includes separate blob containers for zipped&amp;#x2F;unzipped files with Function App triggered by blob storage events for scalable data processing.&lt;/p&gt;

Problem: Missing guidance on linking policies to DevTest Labs using Infrastructure as Code. Solution: Use <code>Microsoft.DevTestLab/labs/policysets</code> resource with ‘default’ name as parent for policy definitions. Implementation includes VM size restrictions, user VM quotas, and premium SSD limits using evaluator types like <code>AllowedValuesPolicy</code> and <code>MaxValuePolicy</code> with proper threshold configurations.</p></blockquote><hr><p>Azure DevTest Labs offers a powerful cloud-based development workstation environment and great alternative to a local development workstation&#x2F;laptop when it comes to software development.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: DevTest Labs Policy Configuration with Bicep IaC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure DevTest Labs documentation covers basic lab deployment but lacks policy configuration examples in Bicep. Problem: Missing guidance on linking policies to DevTest Labs using Infrastructure as Code. Solution: Use &lt;code&gt;Microsoft.DevTestLab/labs/policysets&lt;/code&gt; resource with ‘default’ name as parent for policy definitions. Implementation includes VM size restrictions, user VM quotas, and premium SSD limits using evaluator types like &lt;code&gt;AllowedValuesPolicy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MaxValuePolicy&lt;/code&gt; with proper threshold configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure DevTest Labs offers a powerful cloud-based development workstation environment and great alternative to a local development workstation&amp;#x2F;laptop when it comes to software development. This blog post is not so much talking about the benefits of DevTest Lab, but more about how to create policies for DevTest Labs using Bicep.  Although there is a good support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.devtestlab/labs?pivots=deployment-language-bicep&quot;&gt;deploying DevTest labs with Bicep&lt;/a&gt;, there is little to no documentation when it comes to creating policies for DevTest Labs in Bicep. In this blog post, we will focus on creating policies for DevTest Labs using Bicep and how to go about doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;A-Brief-Overview-of-Azure-DevTest-Labs&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#A-Brief-Overview-of-Azure-DevTest-Labs&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;A Brief Overview of Azure DevTest Labs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A Brief Overview of Azure DevTest Labs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azure DevTest Labs is a managed service that enables developers to quickly create, manage, and share development and test environments. It provides a range of features and tools designed to streamline the development process, minimize costs, and improve overall productivity. By leveraging the power of the cloud, developers can easily spin up virtual machines (VMs) pre-configured with the necessary tools, frameworks, and software needed for their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Existing-Documentation-Limitations&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Existing-Documentation-Limitations&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Existing Documentation Limitations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Existing Documentation Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the existing documentation covers various aspects of Azure DevTest Labs, it lacks clear guidance on setting up policies with DevTest Labs in Bicep. This blog post aims to address that gap by providing a Bicep script for creating a DevTest Lab and applying policies to it. Shout out to my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/illian-yuan&quot;&gt;Illian Y&lt;/a&gt; for persisting and not giving up and finding a away around undocumented features and showing me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr><blockquote><p><strong>🎯 TL;DR: Simulating Multi-User Experience for Legacy Single-Threaded Apps</strong></p><p>Legacy single-threaded applications (one request per process) require multi-user support without costly re-architecture. Problem: Applications with static locks block entire process during request handling. Solution: Azure Container Apps with HTTP-based scaling rules that spawn new container instances per concurrent request. Configuration uses min-replicas&#x3D;0, max-replicas&#x3D;30 with HTTP scale triggers, achieving 70-90% request isolation across separate container instances for pseudo-multithreaded behavior without code changes.</p></blockquote><hr><p>How to make a single-threaded app multi-threaded? This is the scenario I faced very recently. These were legacy web app(s) written to be single-threaded; in this context single-threaded means can only serve one request at a time. <strong>I know this goes against everything that a web app should be</strong>, but it what it is.</p><p>So if we have a single threaded web app (legacy) now all of a sudden we have a requirement to support multiple users at the same time. What are our options:</p><ol><li>Re-architect the app to be multi threaded</li><li>Find a way to simulate multi threaded behavior</li></ol><p>Both are great options, but in this scenario option 1 was out, due to the cost involved in re-writing this app to support multi threading.  So that leaves us with option 2; how can we at a cloud infra level <strong>easily</strong> simulate multi threaded behavior. Turns out if we containerize the app (in this case it was easy enough to do) we orchestrate the app such that for each http request is routed to a new container (ie: every new http request should spin up a new container and request send to it)</p><h2 id="Options-For-Running-Containers"><a href="#Options-For-Running-Containers" class="headerlink" title="Options For Running Containers"></a>Options For Running Containers</h2><p>So when it comes to running a container in Azure our main options are below<br><img src="/Azure/Container-Apps/create-a-multi-user-experience-for-single-threaded-applications-using-azure-container-apps/container-options.png" alt=" " title="Container Options"></p><span id="more"></span><p>Here we need to orchestrate containers, ie: at a minimum for every new http request spin a new one), which means we only have two viable options, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Apps (ACA).  Both are valid options, each with their own pros&#x2F;cons, with AKS its a lot more complex we will need to :</p><blockquote><ul><li>Think of networking</li><li>Think of vm’s&#x2F;vm scale sets for nodes</li><li>Choose ingress controller and set up ingress rules</li><li>Identity</li><li>Plus many more, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks#network-topology">here is the baseline reference for AKS</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>So in short, as flexible as AKS is its not as easy as something like ACA which is a fully managed version of AKS that abstracts all the complexities of Kubernetes. So for this scenario to prove we can simulate multi threaded experience lets go ahead with ACA.</p><h2 id="Sample-Single-Threaded-Program"><a href="#Sample-Single-Threaded-Program" class="headerlink" title="Sample Single Threaded Program"></a>Sample Single Threaded Program</h2><p>For this demo below is a simple C# DotNet app that simulates a single threaded behavior, essentially its doing a lock on a static variable which blocks the whole process for 6 seconds.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Simulating Multi-User Experience for Legacy Single-Threaded Apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legacy single-threaded applications (one request per process) require multi-user support without costly re-architecture. Problem: Applications with static locks block entire process during request handling. Solution: Azure Container Apps with HTTP-based scaling rules that spawn new container instances per concurrent request. Configuration uses min-replicas&amp;#x3D;0, max-replicas&amp;#x3D;30 with HTTP scale triggers, achieving 70-90% request isolation across separate container instances for pseudo-multithreaded behavior without code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to make a single-threaded app multi-threaded? This is the scenario I faced very recently. These were legacy web app(s) written to be single-threaded; in this context single-threaded means can only serve one request at a time. &lt;strong&gt;I know this goes against everything that a web app should be&lt;/strong&gt;, but it what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we have a single threaded web app (legacy) now all of a sudden we have a requirement to support multiple users at the same time. What are our options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-architect the app to be multi threaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a way to simulate multi threaded behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are great options, but in this scenario option 1 was out, due to the cost involved in re-writing this app to support multi threading.  So that leaves us with option 2; how can we at a cloud infra level &lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt; simulate multi threaded behavior. Turns out if we containerize the app (in this case it was easy enough to do) we orchestrate the app such that for each http request is routed to a new container (ie: every new http request should spin up a new container and request send to it)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr><blockquote><p><strong>🎯 TL;DR: AGIC Direct Pod Ingress for High-Performance AKS Workloads</strong></p><p>AGIC provides direct pod ingress bypassing Kubernetes ClusterIP for up to 50% lower network latency compared to in-cluster solutions. Problem: Traditional ingress controllers add network hops and consume AKS compute resources. Solution: Application Gateway routes directly to pod IPs via Azure Resource Manager integration, offering WAF, SSL termination, and managed updates as AKS add-on. Critical limitation: 100 backend pool limit means 2000+ services require 20 Application Gateways, making cost-effective deployment challenging for large-scale clusters.</p></blockquote><hr><p>Recently I ran into an interesting issue with an AKS cluster running 2000+ services.  There is nothing wrong in running 2000+ services that’s what Kubernetes is there for, scale!  but the interesting aspect that caught my attention was trying to get the Applicaiton Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) to ingress to all these services. I had worked with Istio and NGINX for ingress into AKS with no issues and never AGIC, so I had to try this to see where it worked well, what the advantages are and where the limitations are.</p><h2 id="Application-Gateway"><a href="#Application-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="Application Gateway"></a>Application Gateway</h2><p>Application Gateway (App Gateway) is a well-established layer 7 service that has been around for a while, some of the major features are:</p><ul><li>URL routing</li><li>Cookie-based affinity</li><li>SSL termination</li><li>End-to-end SSL</li><li>Support for public, private, and hybrid web sites</li><li>Integrated web application firewall</li><li>Zone redundancy</li><li>Connection draining</li></ul><p>This post isn’t focused on the App Gateway itself, it’s more about how and what it can do as an ingress controller for AKS. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/features">You can find out more about App Gateway and all abouts its features here</a></p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="TLDR"><a href="#TLDR" class="headerlink" title="TLDR;"></a>TLDR;</h2><h3 id="Benefits-of-AGIC"><a href="#Benefits-of-AGIC" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of AGIC"></a>Benefits of AGIC</h3><blockquote><ul><li>Direct connection to the pods without an extra hop, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/blog/application-gateway-ingress-controller-for-azure-kubernetes-service/#:~:text=Solution%20performance">this results in a performance benefit up to 50% lower network latency compared to in-cluster ingress</a></li><li>Could make a huge difference in performance and latency sensitive applications and workloads</li><li>If going the AKS add-on route then it becomes fully managed and updated</li><li>In cluster ingress consumes and competes for AKS compute&#x2F;memory resources where was with App Gateway separated from the cluster it won’t be leeching any of the AKS compute</li><li>Full benefits of the Application Gateway such as WAF, cookie-based affinity, ssl termination amongst many others</li></ul></blockquote><h4 id="Limitations"><a href="#Limitations" class="headerlink" title="Limitations"></a>Limitations</h4><blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#application-gateway-limits">Application Gateway has some backend limits.

Before moving any further with AGIC, we need to understand at a high-level how networking works in AKS.</p><p>There are two main network models:</p><ol><li><p>Kubenet networking</p><blockquote><ul><li>Default option for Kubernetes out of the box</li><li>Each Node receives an IP from the Azure virtual network subnet</li><li>Pods in the node are not associated to the Azure vnet, they are assigned an IP address from the <em>PodIPCidr</em> and a route table is created by AKS</li></ul></blockquote></li><li><p>Azure Container Networking Interface networking (CNI)</p><blockquote><ul><li>Each pod itself receives an IPaddress from the Azure virtual network subnet</li><li>Pods can be directly reached via their private IP from connected networks</li><li>Pods can access resources in the vnet directly with out issues (e.g.: function app in the same vnet)</li></ul></blockquote></li></ol><p>It’s important to note, once you create an AKS cluster with a given network model you can’t change it; you will have to create a new one. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-network#compare-network-models">There are advantages and disadvantages in both models which are listed in detail in this link</a>.</p><p>One key consideration to highlight is:</p><ul><li>Kubenet - &#x2F;24 IP range can support up to 251 nodes (each subnet reserves the first 3 IP addresses for management operations).  Given the maximum nodes per pod in Kubenet is 110, this configuration can support a maximum of 251 * 110 &#x3D; 27,610 pods</li><li>CNI - the same &#x2F;24 IP range can support a maximum of 8 nodes (CNI has a max of thirty pods per node). So, this configuration can support a maximum of 240</li></ul><p>When it comes to CNI you will have to plan for the IP addresses, you might need to a &#x2F;16 range to get a bigger node count.  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/configure-kubenet#limitations--considerations-for-kubenet">There are also limitations with the kubenet that will need to be taken into consideration</a>.</p><p>With the AKS networking models out of the way, let’s look at AGIC; regardless of which model is chosen, the goal for AGIC is to ingress directly to the pod, a simple representation of this can be seen below.  AGIC when deployed, runs in a pod in the AKS cluster and watches for changes, when changes are detected (i.e.: a new pod has been added or existing pod removed) these IP changes are propagated to the App Gateway via the Azure Resource Manager.</p><div class="mxgraph-container">    <div class="mxgraph" style="max-width:100%;border:1px solid transparent;" data-mxgraph="{&quot;highlight&quot;:&quot;#0000ff&quot;,&quot;lightbox&quot;:false,&quot;nav&quot;:true,&quot;resize&quot;:false,&quot;page&quot;:0,&quot;toolbar&quot;:&quot;lightbox zoom layers pages&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ricky-G/draw-io/main/AGIC-Ingress-AKS.drawio&quot;}"></div></div><p>If we went with the CNI networking model, then the pod would get IP address from the vnet and there would be a mapping in the App Gateway.  Alternatively, with the Kubenet model <a href="https://azure.github.io/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/how-tos/networking/#with-kubenet">this is how App Gateway will be setup</a>, it will try to assign the same routable created by AKS to App Gateway’s subnet.</p><p>It’s important to note, whichever model you choose the App Gateway will always connect directly to the pod and this is by design.</p><h2 id="Deploying-AGIC"><a href="#Deploying-AGIC" class="headerlink" title="Deploying AGIC"></a>Deploying AGIC</h2><p>AGIC can be deployed in two ways <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-overview#difference-between-helm-deployment-and-AKS-add-on">either using Helm or as an AKS add-on</a>. Each has their pros and cons, the key benefit of going via an AKS add-on will be that it will be fully managed and auto updated by Azure (i.e.: all updates, patching etc. for the AGIC will be taken care of automatically) whereas with Helm you will have to do that yourself.</p><p>Let’s go ahead and deploy a demo AKS cluster with AGIC and see it in action to understand exactly what is going on. For the sake of simplicity, this demo will be creating an AKS cluster with CNI networking model and deploying the AGIC as and AKS add-on.</p><h3 id="Create-an-AKS-cluster"><a href="#Create-an-AKS-cluster" class="headerlink" title="Create an AKS cluster"></a>Create an AKS cluster</h3><p><strong>Login and set the right subscription</strong></p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">az login</span><br><span class="line">az account <span class="built_in">set</span> -s <span class="string">&quot;your-subcription-id&quot;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><strong>Create a new resource group</strong></p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">az group create --name agicTestResourceGroup --location eastus</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here we are creating a new AKS cluster with CNI networking model (–network-plugin azure) and we are setting up App Gateway as ingress and in this instance we are saying our App Gateway’s name is “testAppGateway” which doesn’t exist and will be created for us</p><p><strong>Create AKS cluster</strong></p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">az aks create -n agicTestCluster -g agicTestResourceGroup --network-plugin azure --enable-managed-identity -a ingress-appgw --appgw-name testAppGateway --appgw-subnet-cidr <span class="string">&quot;10.225.0.0/16&quot;</span> --generate-ssh-keys</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>If we go into the Azure Portal, we can see two resource groups (one of them is what we created and this where the Azure managed AKS control plane is), the other resource group (MC_agicTestResourceGroup_agicTestCluster_eastus) is where the node pool, vnet, App Gateway etc all live, this resource group gets created automatically for us as part of the <em>az aks create</em> command.</p><p><img src="/AKS/AGIC/application-gateway-ingress-controller-for-aks/aks-resource-group.png" alt=" " title="AKS Resource Group"></p><p><img src="/AKS/AGIC/application-gateway-ingress-controller-for-aks/app-gateway-resource-group.png" alt=" " title="App Gateway Resource Group"></p><h2 id="Deploy-a-sample-API"><a href="#Deploy-a-sample-API" class="headerlink" title="Deploy a sample API"></a>Deploy a sample API</h2><p>Now we have the AKS cluster up and running with AGIC deployed as an add-on, let’s deploy a sample API app and set ingress through the App Gateway.</p><p><strong>Get credentials to the AKS cluster</strong></p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">az aks get-credentials -n agicTestCluster -g agicTestResourceGroup</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><strong>Deploy a sample API</strong></p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">kubectl apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Ricky-G/59eb109913bd45d3e9229f9cf0a97edc/raw/b336047feecd9fd89fbe1a9627ac385b525124fe/sample-api-aks-deployment.yaml</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The above sample API deployment yaml was taken from the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/docs/examples/aspnetapp.yaml">AGIC GitHub repo</a>, the only change made to it was added a minimum of 10 replicas.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: AGIC Direct Pod Ingress for High-Performance AKS Workloads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGIC provides direct pod ingress bypassing Kubernetes ClusterIP for up to 50% lower network latency compared to in-cluster solutions. Problem: Traditional ingress controllers add network hops and consume AKS compute resources. Solution: Application Gateway routes directly to pod IPs via Azure Resource Manager integration, offering WAF, SSL termination, and managed updates as AKS add-on. Critical limitation: 100 backend pool limit means 2000+ services require 20 Application Gateways, making cost-effective deployment challenging for large-scale clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I ran into an interesting issue with an AKS cluster running 2000+ services.  There is nothing wrong in running 2000+ services that’s what Kubernetes is there for, scale!  but the interesting aspect that caught my attention was trying to get the Applicaiton Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) to ingress to all these services. I had worked with Istio and NGINX for ingress into AKS with no issues and never AGIC, so I had to try this to see where it worked well, what the advantages are and where the limitations are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Application-Gateway&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Application-Gateway&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Application Gateway&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Application Gateway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application Gateway (App Gateway) is a well-established layer 7 service that has been around for a while, some of the major features are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URL routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookie-based affinity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL termination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-to-end SSL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for public, private, and hybrid web sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated web application firewall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zone redundancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connection draining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn’t focused on the App Gateway itself, it’s more about how and what it can do as an ingress controller for AKS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/features&quot;&gt;You can find out more about App Gateway and all abouts its features here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

This means we wont be getting any vnet capability and our function and logic apps will be exposed out to the world (remember to get vnet with APIM we have to go with the premium version, we are going APIM standard here for cost saving reasons).</p><p>So how do we restrict our function and logic apps to only go through the APIM, in another words all our function and logic apps <strong>must only</strong> go through the APIM and if anyone tries to access them directly they should be getting a “HTTP 403 Forbidden”.</p><p>Lets visualize this scenario; We have some WAF capable ingress endpoint, in this case its Azure Front Door, that is forwarding traffic to APIM which then sends the requests to the serverless apps.<br>Reason for having Front Door before APIM is because APIM doesn’t have WAF natively so we <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#ns-6-deploy-web-application-firewall">will need to put something in front of it that has that capability to be secure</a>. </p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#ns-6-deploy-web-application-firewall">There are few options like Azure Firewall, Application Gateway etc</a>, but for the purposes of this scenario we have Azure Front Door in front of APIM (and we can have an APIM policy that will only accept traffic from Azure Font Door, we wont be going in to that, we will keep it to securing our function apps to just being available via APIM for today)</p><p><img src="/Azure/Function-Apps/Security/securing-azure-functions-and-logic-apps/apim-azure-functions-backend.png" alt=" " title="Sample Scenario"></p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Securing-the-function-app"><a href="#Securing-the-function-app" class="headerlink" title="Securing the function app"></a>Securing the function app</h2><ol><li>First we will need to get the public ip address of the APIM</li><li>White-list this address in our function app network restrictions</li></ol><h2 id="Getting-the-public-ip-of-APIM"><a href="#Getting-the-public-ip-of-APIM" class="headerlink" title="Getting the public ip of APIM"></a>Getting the public ip of APIM</h2><p>You can go to the APIM resource in the Azure portal and get it from there<br><img src="/Azure/Function-Apps/Security/securing-azure-functions-and-logic-apps/apim-public-ip.png" alt=" " title="APIM ip address"></p><p>Or you can use the CLI and run </p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">az apim show --name &quot;apim-name&quot; --resource-group &quot;resource-group-name&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="White-listing-the-function-app"><a href="#White-listing-the-function-app" class="headerlink" title="White-listing the function app"></a>White-listing the function app</h2><ol><li>You need to go into networking -&gt; access restriction</li><li>Only allow the APIM ip (once you enter this, the deny all will automatically come ie: all other ip’s are denied)</li><li>Its important that the SCM site is also blocked. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/resources-kudu">More about Kudu service that powers the SCM site here</a></li></ol><p><img src="/Azure/Function-Apps/Security/securing-azure-functions-and-logic-apps/func-ip-restriction-1.png" alt=" " title="Function app ip restrictions"></p><p><img src="/Azure/Function-Apps/Security/securing-azure-functions-and-logic-apps/func-ip-restriction-2.png" alt=" " title="Function app block all ips except APIM"></p><p><img src="/Azure/Function-Apps/Security/securing-azure-functions-and-logic-apps/func-ip-restriction-3.png" alt=" " title="Make sure to block the SCM site also"></p><h2 id="What-happens-if-you-try-to-access-this-function"><a href="#What-happens-if-you-try-to-access-this-function" class="headerlink" title="What happens if you try to access this function"></a>What happens if you try to access this function</h2><p>Now its all blocked we get a nice HTTP 403 Forbidden</p><p><img src="/Azure/Function-Apps/Security/securing-azure-functions-and-logic-apps/func-ip-restriction-4.png" alt=" " title="Make sure to block the SCM site also"></p><h2 id="What-about-deploying-code-to-this-function-via-GitHub-Actions"><a href="#What-about-deploying-code-to-this-function-via-GitHub-Actions" class="headerlink" title="What about deploying code to this function via GitHub Actions"></a>What about deploying code to this function via GitHub Actions</h2><p>When you try to deploy to these functions using GitHub Actions or even via Azure Devops you will get the same HTTP 403 and wont be able to deploy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎯 TL;DR: Cost-Optimized Security for Serverless Microservices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumption plan Function Apps and APIM Standard lack VNet integration for cost optimization but expose services publicly. Problem: Serverless microservices accessible directly bypassing API Management security policies. Solution: IP restriction-based security using APIM’s public IP address to whitelist only API Management access, configuring both main site and SCM site restrictions. Architecture includes Azure Front Door for WAF capabilities since APIM Standard lacks native WAF protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a scenario that I recently encountered. Imagine we are building micro-services using serverless (a mix on Azure Function Apps and Logic Apps) with APIM in the front.  Lets say we went with the APIM standard instance and all the logic and function apps are going to be running on consumption plan (for cost reasons as its cheaper).  This means we wont be getting any vnet capability and our function and logic apps will be exposed out to the world (remember to get vnet with APIM we have to go with the premium version, we are going APIM standard here for cost saving reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we restrict our function and logic apps to only go through the APIM, in another words all our function and logic apps &lt;strong&gt;must only&lt;/strong&gt; go through the APIM and if anyone tries to access them directly they should be getting a “HTTP 403 Forbidden”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets visualize this scenario; We have some WAF capable ingress endpoint, in this case its Azure Front Door, that is forwarding traffic to APIM which then sends the requests to the serverless apps.&lt;br&gt;Reason for having Front Door before APIM is because APIM doesn’t have WAF natively so we &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#ns-6-deploy-web-application-firewall&quot;&gt;will need to put something in front of it that has that capability to be secure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#ns-6-deploy-web-application-firewall&quot;&gt;There are few options like Azure Firewall, Application Gateway etc&lt;/a&gt;, but for the purposes of this scenario we have Azure Front Door in front of APIM (and we can have an APIM policy that will only accept traffic from Azure Font Door, we wont be going in to that, we will keep it to securing our function apps to just being available via APIM for today)&lt;/p&gt;
